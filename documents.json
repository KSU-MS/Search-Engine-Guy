Thankfully it was only a rear wing and not a monocoque Need to have a radio on the Ecar when its running. Potential damage to the precharge may have been prevented. Steering effort on the Ecar is fine until you reach the wall and then it becomes numb and hard to feel the car. | asked John what to do when the car continued to understeer after rear toe out and he suggested less steering angle. It was hard to find that limit due to the steering effort. In general, need more grip and easier steering We should do an autocross test day with different throttle maps. | preferred linear over exponential, but maybe there\u2019s another that feels better. Ecar floor is very weak. | hopped into the car and the floor cracked and pulled out. Should probably be like the IC one where you can nearly stand on it. Ecar seat isn\u2019t stiff enough. Seat was never in the same place after removed due to it flexing and going in sideways.

Intake should be as reliable as currently, if going to carbon.. prove it is as tough Fuel injector data is def worth getting. Set up test rig, test. Also to find deadband, decrease PW until hardly any fuel comes out Need to look into calculating AFR targets better. Also test, so lots of dyno work seeing which afr is best suited. Different tunes for events. IE eco mode for endurance Have actual tests to test to for reliability, IE cranking less than 2 seconds, idle less than 1500 rpm, etc. More tuning work. Have car up to temp, this should be the baseline. Then work backwards to adjust WUE AE and such accordingly Log headers help with sound Closed loop fuel is good, but takes some work to have it not be a pain Solve for gearing, need diff final drive. Take gear curves, along with torque curve and match the two. Not using other 4 gears is very inefficient. More math for cooling system Dry sump can be good, but balance weight and CG, judge thought less weight is better than lower CG to an extent. Test more shift times, improve and know the shift time.

How can we ensure it doesn\u2019t happen again? Having the constant tech sheets really helped us pass mechanical tech relatively easy Even though acc got finished last minute, good job on passing accumulator tech. Design Putting the accumulator in seemed clunky and cumbersome Need to ensure the front end of the chassis is the same as the 5 if we are gonna use the same front wing. This one was shorter and thus made the wing illegal with the old mounts. o Need to come up with a better way to jig the welded mounts to reduce any alignment issues there. Judges still don\u2019t like how taller people fit in the car due to the pedals. Need to make sure the body mold is symmetrical Aero wise, we think the judges prefer the May version of the design presentation instead of the honest version.

We would like assurance that this will be the case, as spending an entire fiscal years' budget from around November to June is a tall ask and a gross oversight, especially with the current limitations on volume and expense of the ordering regimen. This removal of rollover between fiscal years will only create a harder \"crunch\" to get orders confirmed faster and in larger quantity, putting more load on those who place orders in the first place and nullifying a motive for not allowing orders on Fridays to Louise anyway. To these points specifically: e Will P Card limits be raised to compensate for the intended removal of rollover? e Will more staff be available to fulfill orders for competition teams even if P Card limits will not be raised?

Thank you, Kennesaw Motorsports Chief open log Page 24 Letter to Matt PT2 Monday, April 18, 2022 12:45 AM Matt, Frankly, the majority of this email's contents are troubling, but perhaps that can be remedied with some supplemental information not present in the initial inspection, please address all questions, as it is all important to us. | see that you \"anticipate\" the process for securing funding to be \"significantly earlier\" for next fiscal year's funding securement. We would like assurance that this will be the case, as spending an entire fiscal years\u2019 budget from around November to June is a tall ask and a gross oversight, especially with the current limitations on volume and expense of the ordering regimen. This removal of rollover between fiscal years will only create a harder \"crunch\" to get orders confirmed faster and in larger quantity, putting more load on those who place orders in the first place and nullifying a motive for not allowing orders on Fridays to Louise anyway. Yes, the Alumni Committee and | are planning for the allocation process to start early in the school year rather than later during the semester. In terms of the funds left over by end of June 30, Dr. Laureano was able to work with the KSU Foundation to keep the funds unspent from the current fiscal year",

The process where the teams will be doing presentations in front of the Student Outreach Committee will take into consideration your unspent funds from FY22. We certainly appreciate how our student competition teams worked with us as we finalized staffing for processing orders. It is Dr.Laureano\u2019s expectation that our reconciliation of funds, transparency with the teams, and effectiveness in the processes remain our priority and for that effort we are beginning the conversations that will help us accelerate the funding request process while still allowing the competition teams to spend their FY22 remaining funds once the new fiscal year begins. Please remember as we are approaching year end process for the university, spending for this fiscal year and year end processes must be followed by us and thus we will need your assistance in prioritizing those items needed for your upcoming competitions. To these points specifically: e Will P Card limits be raised to compensate for the intended removal of rollover? The single transaction limit for her pcard has been increased, which will alleviate the bottleneck with order processing. We follow the state of Georgia policies for pcard and thus her cycle transaction limit will remain as is and if she needs to ask for a temporary increase we will do that. Again, adjusting her single transaction",

PCARD limits for single transaction limits have been raised for Louise, thus allowing for her to not have delays in the ordering process. Please note that we are working closely with Louise to ensure that her time is allocated based on the student competition\u2019s team needs, ensuring that the balances on each of the team\u2019s funds is up to date, and that orders are processed and received as quickly as possible. Louise is wonderful at what she does and | do not fault her for ours and everyone else's ordering woes and we accept giving her a day of rest for Friday; are these policies (upcoming and current) outlined somewhere for public view? We would like all stipulations for ordering by Competition Teams to be outlined clearly and publicly so that confusion nor surprise arises in the future. The purpose of using Fridays is for her to pause processing orders so that she may focus on account reconciliation, setting up time for in person questions from the teams, etc. Events: We will be traveling to Competition twice at Michigan International Soeedway e May: 15-23 o $1,500 for gas to May competition \u2014",

Regarding this change for the next fiscal year: e This is a new change: was this decision voted upon, and if so, by whom and when? Decisions on how to proceed with funding is based on how the teams are spending their funds and what rules govern funding sources. For example, we know that KSU Foundation allocates a certain amount of funds for each fiscal year which is where the funding requests you are all approved to receive come from, and thus what we are trying to do is ensure that we are spending what we have been allocated first.

You continue: \"The process where the teams will be doing presentations in front of the Student Outreach Committee will take into consideration your unspent funds from FY22.\" e Last year, we were personally assured that unspent funds would not be taken into account for Student Presentations.

This was not the case in previous years, and we have documentation of statements spanning across fiscal years to back this claim up. We have coordinated with Louise about documenting our balance on a month-end basis, but we are missing most of FY21, and every month since September of 2021. We would like to cross reference our spending habits per month versus this established value.

We took the current cars practice times dilled in after comp to a standard deviation of .02 and projected where that car could place. This info allowed us to project in our ranked priority change list what changes were most necessary for advancement and what could be achieved in our budget. In our plotting of the 22 season a placement within 125% of winning time would prove to be a top 15 finish in dynamics. As seen in the box and whiskers plots. Given our points mass model we developed a change list of critical car parameters to meet in the new iteration. Our goals are much more centered on getting a car no only through tech but also in the 125% to score points in each event. Short: Analsys of 22 results Charcitersation of current car.

A dyno uses two drums to create a rolling resistance against the tires of a car. The weight and acceleration of the drums can then be used to calculate the amount of power that an engine produces. How to set up the dyno: Hopefully the first time you are trying to dyno a car someone has shown you but if not then this should help. First you need to get the WinPEP7 software off dynojet's website: https://www.dynojet.com/downloads/dynamometer/software-firmware After you download that you need to go and place this config file in the Program files (x86)>WinPEP7 directory If you use the data7 (new).cfg rename it to data 7.cfg data7 (new) _| data7 This will allow your computer to connect with the towers that power some of the dyno components. Next you need to power on those towers. Then plug the computer in. To read AFR through WinPEP7 you need to put the O2 sensor connected to the tower in the exhaust To read RPM on the software you will want to take the clamp that is also connected to the towers and clamp it around the coil wires and clamp the other on the cars ground.

First roll the car STRAIGHT on the dyno then start ratcheting back till the car is in about the middle of the drum. Then ratchet the front and back at the same time. Most importantly roll the dyno with your foot in the direction the car will turn it and ensure that the car tracks straight. This last step insures the car wont crab walk off. Getting a graph: Make sure no one is around the tires or behind the dyno and that the exhaust gasses have proper ventilation. The driver also needs to understand that he should not slam on the breaks after the run to eliminate extra stress on the straps. Next get someone in the car and wearing the proper equipment (full racing suit, shoes, helmet, gloves, etc). Once the driver gets the wheels turning give them a signal to give it the beans. When you give this signal press the green button on the control connected to the towers to start a sample. They will need to make sure to give it full throttle. The most accurate results will be the gear ratio closet to 1:1. However, you can rip through all the gears if you want. After the driver hits redline or lets off press the green button to end the sample. The graph will then be displayed on the laptop and saved in the",

ADDED 12-16-22 The load can be enabled through the pendent by holding the green button while rolling. The amount can then be set in the software by either the value in the bottom left, or by dragging the white arrow on the outside of the load gauge.

This also helps insure that you are achieving a good volumetric efficiency (VE) How to tune The ECU uses a software called tuner studio. This software has a premium version to allow for some auto tune features | will get into later. First there are a few things you should check. What is the firing order for that engine.

Are the injectors and coils in the right order (check this with the test mode) Are your sensors calibrated correctly do those values make sense for what the car is doing when not running. If the engine is not hitting check to see if the cam and crank are logging in the high speed logger. Tuning fundamentals Once the car is running you should check your AFR (air to fuel ratio) if this is not within 12.7-14.8 after warming up you should adjust the VE table until the AFR is within those ranges. (this can be done with auto tune). After this you will want to let the car cool down and see if the WUE (warm up enrichment) looks like a gradual slope and that the AFR offset goals look adequate. Assuming you are running a fixed timing you will want to start implementing the timing table. You will have to make an educated guess on what the timing should be and keep bellow 6k until the timing values are worked out well. After that you will want to up the rev limit 1k at a",

To start you will want to duplicate the timing from the column to the left to the new column. Then edit according to sound again. At some point you will need to stop and get nock sensors because once you can here the knock something is already damaged. So progress at your own risk and level of knowledge. More advanced tuning Run the car with sequential injection and spark, this will require a CAM sensor so the ECU know the exact events to do these rather than just wasted spark and fuel. To achieve more accuracy you should also run the car off the MAP (mass airflow pressure) this will tell the ECU exactly how much air it can get rather than how open the throttle is. The AFR will very per each cylinder so at some point you should put an O2 in each runner. Engine and Drivetrain Page 12 Jesse D.

Here are the values updated in the tune on the car as of today: Bias resistor value was chosen from an assumed 24900hm pullup to 5V resistor as standard. (update as of 2/28/2023, this should not be a \"assumed\" 24900hm pullup as the curve is different with different resistor values. The curve given to us by syltech uses a 1k pull up, but math can be done to correct the curve.) Calibrate Thermistor Tables...

        "text": "complete oil cooler test as per procedure. Took a bit to get running as noted in the car log, but we were able to get it going on the dyno. The following logs were taken while figuring out the dyno brake and other factors. The first log, On, has a recorded event of the burst place popping near the end of the log at the small RPM spike. The final log, On3, is the final and actual test run we conducted. We were able to get 57.6 seconds into the test under 100% TPS before the muffler started shooting sparks/cat material all over dyno, and then the test was stopped. The video below shows the aftermath of the muffler immediately after. The current theory is the built in cat in the muffler got super heated and started burning. It may have been possible to continue running, but it was decided to stop the run. With such a short run time, the test is inconclusive and thus the oil cooler should be kept on until further testing is done. The oil temps did reach 210\u00b0F by the end of the 57.6 seconds, with coolant at 225\u00b0F, however this does not mean too much as the CLT temps were still higher than the oil, and thus the oil was still coming up to temperature.

This marks the end of Headers testing on ETS. (mph) Final notes on test: The VEAL and afr aspect of the test was negated as there were no mufflers which would fit each set of headers. The sound recording was omitted as each header went beyond the limits of the sound meter's measuring device. Data was collected on the two sets of headers, with the second set of headers only having one run. We attempted to test the log, but the reinforced mounts we added prevented the headers from being mounted. All in all, some useful data was collected from the runs and can be used to design the new sets of headers. It would have been good to test more sets of headers, but considering the situation of the test we are satisfied with the testing.

Does it have manageable power delivery? This category focuses on design of the drive management systems, motor(s), accumulators and drivel ine. Where appropriate, understanding of failure modes and critical limp-home requirements should be addressed. Teams should demonstrate competent and reasonable analysis methods, appropriate physical execution, and validation within their design. Sample areas include, but are not limited to: o Are the benefits of electric motors fully utilized (e.g. over powering/boosting, regenerative braking, vehicle control)? o Is the system well packaged/integrated into the remainder of the vehicle? oO Has a good balance of Make vs. Buy decisions been employed? o Were motor(s) appropriately selected and developed? Does the team have a good insight in the limitations of their motor(s) and the trade-offs on weight and energy efficiency? o Which power/torque ratio is chosen? Are the reasons for this understood? o Are cooling systems properly sized for the motor, battery, electronics, accumulator, etc...? o Is the accumulator configuration properly designed to meet the team's stated goals? (e.g. capacity, power, temperature dependence) o Is an energy management strategy clearly defined and implemented? o Temperature management: which are the weakest components and under which conditions? (consider short term and long term failure modes). o Is there data communication/feedback between different parts of the tractive system? o",

This was done by writing some code to control either relay with a serial port input to the teensy, and both worked well. After the missing parts were acquired, the board was fully populated then powered on. There were a few things wrong e The isolated 12v supply was sitting around 1.4V. After reboots it would still be significantly under voltage \u00a9 This was due to the 2904 op-amp making a ~250 ohm short across Iso12v+/- o After connected the iso side to the bench 12v, it blew up the op amp and that\u2019s how | found out it was the problem O The onboard supply was going into over current state because of the short and shutting down to protect itself e Acomponent was getting warm on the tractive system side O This was likely the op amp O | noticed smoke at one point as well e The V-F converters weren't working oO At first, this was due to placing them",

Place the Nyback diode at the DRV103 end when driving long (inductive) cables to a remotely located load, This minimizes RFI EMIE and helps protect the output DMOS transistor from breakdown caused by dl/dt transients, Fast rectifier diodes such as epitaxial silioon or Schottky types are recommended as flyback diodes Screenshot from video posted of test circuit working added 8/1/23 JS DR TOS Busi Cincmit Cormeen.

Develop engagement survey for sponsors (Brittanie) Syltech Sponsor Email Good morning, My name is Steven Tubbs, and | am reaching out on behalf of Kennesaw Motorsports. We are a Collegiate Formula SAE team from Kennesaw, Georgia, USA. We have been looking for a new suite of sensors to use on our Internal Combustion (IC) car and came across your sensor lineup. The native use of DTM connectors on your sensors stood out, as we currently utilize the Deutsch lineup to construct the wiring harness for our cars. Having the connector built directly into the sensor housing would allow us to simplify our wiring and decrease the number of failure points in our system. Other combination sensors are sold on the market, but none complement our needs better than yours. We would love to partner with you and bring light to your lineup in our competition series and across the United States. Let me know if we can work something out!

My name is... (go down the line in presentation order)\". Then launch into the slides. |. Push for EV \u2014 Steven \u2014 federal and state rebate a. Governments are pushing for more EV cars b. This provides incentives for businesses to shift their focus from ICE to EV c. So how does that affect us? d. The shift to EV means that companies need to hire individuals that have experience with EV products. Through FSAE we have that experience and can use our skills to grow their company. This is extremely beneficial for the company itself and the development fo their EV program. e. How are we taking advantage of that? i. Design of the KS1E and the KS2E i. Highlight the similarities between the KS5 and KS2E chassis ii. Point out the differences iv.

User Ease of Implementation and Safety: The vehicle's power source should be easy to use, and safety should be a top priority. We should consider userfriendly interfaces and safety features that will protect the driver and passengers. This will involve conducting extensive user testing and ensuring that the new power source meets all safety standards. Market Demand: The company should conduct market research to determine the demand for vehicles powered by a different power source and engage with consumers to understand their needs and preferences.

Implementation and the appendix should support how that differentiation will actually be created and why it makes your customers care (and your competition sweat). e Anote on flow: there's no right answer. It really doesn't matter if you go Intro>customer>product >marketing strategy> implementation or intro>product>customer>competition>marketing strategy/implementation. As long as the order is logical and helps you tell your story, it's good! With that in mind, here's some ways to do this throughout your presentation. Play around with the order and see what makes the most sense to you. \u00a9. Intro = what we want to talk to you about and why you should listen * (in public speaking, this is called the \"hook.\" It's what catches the audience's attention at the beginning.

Here's some ideas: https://www.skillpacks.com/presentation-hook/ BONUS POINTS if you close your presentation in reference with the same hook. O Customer = who we are selling to and why they want our product over the competition's product. Describe the target market. Is there a specific pain point or problem that the customer has? Describe it. You want to be able to walk through life in their shoes and really understand why they buy what they buy. O Competitors = the other ways that the customer can resolve their pain point or solve their problem other than you. O Product = our solution to the customer need. You can also introduce the competition here. These two sections are closely intertwined. O. Climax = what makes our offering different from the competition (in business terms, this is your product differentiation and competitive advantage). Explain how your product resolves the customer pain point or solves their problem. Show how you do this better than the competition. O Implementation = supporting information to prove how all of this will be done in reasonable terms (like SMART goals) Target Market: \u00a2 Do people really still think that EV's are slow? e Make sure graphs are well defined, clear, and relevant (include units of measure with numerical values.) e All data should be backed up.

Where does your company fall in this supply chain? If refiners are the bottleneck, how much do they produce annually? Is that enough to sustain your current and projected demand? If not, are there any alternatives? To dive extra deep, take a look at the geographical region of the raw materials sources and refiners locations. Why are they there?

In 1989, Renault changed direction and the SCCA made the decision to replace the original Renault drivetrain with a 1.9-liter engine and five-speed transmission manufactured by the Ford Motor Company, eventually changing the Sport Renault (SR) name to Spec Racer\u00ae Ford (SRF). In 2013 (because of declining availability of engine parts) we announced the Spec Racer\u00ae Ford Gen3 (1.6 Liter Ford Sigma motor) under the supervision of Technical Director Mike Davies. Since the launch of the SRF Gen3 we have successfully completed over 500 Gen2 to Gen3 conversions. Today, the Spec Racer\u00ae Ford class is the #2 subscribed national class with over 35 years history producing top notch, affordable and safe racing cars.\" Substitutes: EV conversion kits (EV West) - also these Implementation: Provide the labor and the chassis for EV conversions?

Shock dyno is live time of shock at potential points, instead of points at actual turns Shock pot gives specific displacements for specific areas If you had shock characterized, would you be able to use other sensors to get the displacements/info for dampening that sammy wants?

For tubes and parts with small internal volumes that we do not care about the flow around like the chassis tubes simply make them a solid body and merge them together. This will reduce the amount of cells required ad reduce the mesh complexity. Importing models: There are a few methods to import models. There are three different import options. Import in to 3d- CAD model, import mesh, and import CAE Model. Because we are using STAR CCM+ built in mesher and the CAE model import option is a Siemens exclusive file type the import that is being used is import CAD model into 3D-CAD. This setting can be found under File->Import->Import CAD Model into 3D-CAD. This import option can be found in the toolbar as well and is the isometric cube with a curved arrow coming out of the middle. Importable files: While STAR-CCM+ claims you can import Solidworks files whenever you try to use a solidworks part file or assembly it gives an error of no imported bodies. To get around this you should use a parasolid file. You can do this by saving the solidworks part or assembly as a parasolid file .x_t or .x_b.

Ensure that the front/inlet of the block is 2-4 times the length of the car from the front of the car while the rear/outlet is 5-10 times the car length behind it. If a reversed flow error occurs increase the distance between the outlet and the back of the car.

If not prompted to enter the meshing models select Surface remesher, Automatic Surface Repair, Polyhedral Mesher, and Prism Layer Mesher. After selecting the parts that the automated mesh will be applied to an exclamation point in a yellow triangle will be displayed on the symbol. This is not an error and simply means that the mesher has not been executed yet Before adjusting anything to get a finer mesh run the automated mesh to check for any errors. If the Chassis tubes are not merged together or made to be one solid part then you may encounter an error regarding manifold vertices and faces or other errots due to the way in which the chassis tubes are modeled with surfaces.

This small effect will be seen in minor oscillations of force and residuals graphs. If the oscillations is to great i.e. more than a few percent of variation then you should select unsteady time to better model those flow characteristics.

The model is designed to fit in the aero box, avoid collisions with steering and control arm droop, allow some space for possible anti-roll bar(s), and allow iteration in CFD. This model needs ride height studies along with inlet/outlet studies. Another point of interest is feed and interaction from the front wing. One point of interest on this design is the theory that curvature might help allow a smoother flow but this is unproven. We are also interested in the possibility of adding winglets to the back of the diffuser as well as strakes underneath the car and the effect they would have. We will later consider studying the effects of front wing vortex generators and how they may help maintain undertray downforce. Other important studies might include roll, pitch, and yaw studies as the undertray is sensitive to all 3 of these conditions. Aero Page 35 Concept B This concept has similar design goals to concept A. It includes 3 sections but no curvature for more simplicity. It also includes strakes and a Nolder NX along the trailing edge of the diffuser section. One idea we had was to extend the section between the wheels and the chassis to have a 2\u2122 smaller inlet that feeds from approximately where the front wing is through under the control arms and into the main undertray where its flow combines with the existing intake.

Caused power to cut out because you had to return to 0 position.-tried going to 120nm, did not fix btw Went back to 240nm Changed brake activation from 3200 to 2800 for and it fixed the issue (changede code in Github).

Set inverter settings to files below and no longer fault at all with the inverter, car can run 240nm (with slightly reduced performance) and seems to be performing well. 10_26_23 Log testing BSPD? Car knocks out of TS (green tsal) while driving, even at different speeds and pedal travel. Driver can put 5% pedal pressure and trip it while pressing gas. Cannot adjust pot on VCU anymore because of the comparator issue. Vmax=Vcc-1.5V, so max setting is 3.71V and thus the pedal trips sooner in the travel range. Brake bleed was poor, which means resting the foot on the pedal or slight presses would trigger BSPD. A better bleed would help this by firming up the pedal, effectively pushing the trip point further back. Rotating the pot could be possible as well, but adjustment is still lacking. Brakes are squishy and fluid was boiling off of rotors Rotors are dirty from brake flush- clean them and don't let fluid get everywhere when bleeding brakes, and please don't contaminate the pads Pedal is squishy- get a better bleed All of the above issues affected BSPD because it set the trip point closer to the pedal travel and caused BSPD to trip easily There was brake fluid in the APPS2, BSE, and Brake overtravel Deutsch connectors, enough to have a standing pool of fluid.

The KS5c body was designed to be as close to one piece as possible. It includes the nose, the top of the car, and some of the sides. The design was done with surface modeling around the frame and components of the car. The mold was decided to be made from insulation foam paneling. This mold will end up being very large, and if it was made from MDF, it would weigh around 200lbs. And | don't think you want to be lugging around a 200Ib mold. It could also be done as two negative mold halves to make the surface finish a lot cleaner right off the bat, but that would require more foam and it would also end up being very difficult to layup the carbon inside the mold (unless you have 5 foot long arms??). Step 1: Machined foam BJ machined 7 individual stacks of foam on Architecture's 5-axis Onsrud CNC mill. This was done because the length of the bit is only so long. It will also avoid having to do 4 or 5 axis CAM work, which is an absolute headache Step 2: Glue up Once the chunks come off the machine, they need to be glued up. We used the same",

        "text": "is an absolute headache Step 2: Glue up Once the chunks come off the machine, they need to be glued up. We used the same glue that was used to initially glue up the layers. It is a specialty spray adhesive made for foam. (3M 78 for Insulation and Polystyrene) As always, make sure you weigh down your parts that are gluing up. Step 3: Initial Foam Prep Sometimes the machine will mess up and leave marks or take chunks out of the part. The controller software sometimes gets confused and will just drop the bit into your pretty part. We don't know why, but it happens. Luckily it's foam so the tool isn't damaged and it's fairly easy to fix. We take expanding spray foam and just spray it into the holes left there. Also add some to any large cracks. Once it is dry, rough sand the whole thing to start to get the surface closer to being smooth. 100 grit works well for this. Think of it like sculpting. Main goal is to get it close to the final shape you want. Step 4: Prep Fiberglass/Start Designing Ply Schedule and \"Maps\" This step is where you will start cutting out your fiberglass to coat the mold. The fiberglass is used here to seal the foam and create a hard, non-porous surface. This is also a good time to start planing your ply schedule and what | call, \"maps.\" The \"maps\" are the individual templates for each piece that you'll put on. Since for",

Since for a complex shape like this, you can't just cover it in one single piece. Either the shape is too complex and requires a computer software to \"unfold\" the 3d shape into a 2d template, or you just can't fit the whole thing onto one piece of carbon/glass (since rolls are only 40\" or 50\" wide). This also gives you a nice time to experiment and see if your \"maps\" will work. You'll want to be putting at least 2 or 3 layers of fiberglass down. There is a good chance you will be adding more fiberglass later. Composites Page 2 Post your questions below and I'll answer them. This way, everyone will be able to see the questions and answers and it will all be here on this document. \u00a2 Question (name) O Answer Step 5: Applying Fiberglass This step is fairly easy. All you're doing is coating the foam in fiberglass to create a hard shell. Make sure to fully wet out the fabric and do your best to make sure it is laying fully flat against the foam. Goal should be for 2 to 3 layers over everything. While you will most likely need to apply more layers later, the better job you do now, the less work you'll have to put in for fixing bubbles or problem spots.

        "text": "now, the less work you'll have to put in for fixing bubbles or problem spots. The resin used can be either the regular epoxy resin we use for layups, or fiberglass resin. The fiberglass resin is a bit cheaper however, so go with that. Make sure to mix in smallish batches however to prevent the bowl of resin from gel-ing up in a few minutes. Amine Blush!! When all epoxy resins dry in open air and exposed to moisture, it will form what is called an amine blush. It is a reaction that happens when the curing resin mixes with moisture in the air. Normally, when under vacuum, there is no air or moisture for it to react with. However, when doing this fiberglass shell, or any other repairs involving epoxy resin, an amine layer will form. It will create this sticky, oily, coating that will make it feel like it is permanently wet. This can be reduced by covering the resin with release film/peel-ply. This way the amine layer will hopefully form on the fabric, instead of your part. You can then remove the peel-ply afterwards. The amine layer can create a few problems. First, it will make subsequent layers of resin, paint, adhesive, etc. not bond properly to the surface. Second, it will clog up your sandpaper within seconds if you try to sand the surface. And we will be doing a lot of sanding on this mold. Luckily, it is fairly easy to remove. Soapy water and a Scotch-brit pad will make quick",

The car was a champ on dyno running and pulling well, with no cooling issues. Cade replaced the spark plugs for fresh one and the startup became instant, they were in bad need of refreshment. The timing table was updated for 2000 to 8500 range. This made a notable difference. Before shake down we tightened up steering and connected oil pressure to the driver readable gauge. On the way to the lot, the clutch was not engaging enough to pull the car well. After some run time this improved a slight bit. During the first 10 labs the car ran wheel with a slight click from the front right wheel. When stopping it was noticed the temp had exceeded our limits to around 300. this is the first time cooling has presented its self as an issue on this car. The coolant line had pressure but needed quite a bit more water ~ 1/4 gallon. After filling we monitored under idle and every 5 laps. The car never exceeded 110. The oil and coolant will be check for mixing tomorrow. The car went well for the next bit but the inner wheel cap for the front right came completely out and hit the push",

We were launching with some wheel spin and no failure. When we lined up to do skidpad | tole em to \"give her the beans\". This resulted in the lower left dif mount failing. This failure was two part. First the moment around the lower motor mount bolt created by the cariear tie in being above the axis of the bolt resulted in a clean shear of the .028 tube and its weld. This failure was due to bad geometry and my sub par weld of a .15 wall to a .028 wall. Part two of the failure was due to the lower bolt being able to pivot allowed the force to be taken by the top mount. The new tensioning system did not slip which resulted in the buckling of the top of the spool carrier. a File OOO To fix before next: Things to note: & File_007 | File_008 a File_008 Car log Page 18 \u2122 i) File_005 Car log Page 19 3/30/21 Thursday, March 18, 2021 12:12 PM Car log Page",

And with the whole things siting on a big shaking block, doesn't help things. There are a million and one adhesives out there. First narrow down by ones that can be exposed to gas/oil and still be fine. Then narrow it down to ones that can bond to carbon, and aluminum, since it will be used on both. How strong does it need to be. We currently use E60-HP because that's what Spencer/Graham recommended. But their use case scenarios aren't the same as ours. Again, dummy strong, but for an intake, does it need to be? It works great for bonding inserts into tubes, but so far, doesn't look like it does too well for intakes. Should still be left with about 100 adhesives, pick like 6 or 8 at least. Test them all. Not quite sure how to make the rig, but i would test for fatigue too. Maybe vibrational fatigue if possible? Bond 2 pieces together, have a small mass on one end and a shaker on the other. Eh. Would be a good way to fully validate adhesive beyond just comparing data sheets and simple shear MITS tests. Would bring testing closer to usage case. And this is just one part of what can be changed. Intake design and mold design can also be changed.

We spoke briefly about Swaging some of our bearings. Bearing being used: HIN4T By FK Bearings https://www.fkrodends.com/products/spherical-bearings/high-misalignment- series/hin-t/ Spherical Housing: 4130 Chromoly housing drawing attached. Machined to light press fit. We have run in to issued with hour current hand steaking wallowing and failing at 400 miles. Our setup only applies vertical load on the bearing towards the lipped direction. However we do see the normal force of our ~8lb assembly and this component does oscillate under harsh driving conditions. We are looking in to alternate ways to get a stronger hold in the vertical direction and a more repeatable process. 4/5/2022 Wednesday, April 6, 2022 1:01 PM Prior: Mesured complyance in toe connections Torqued top hat bolts to 12 FT/LBS turques Pic of front right tire Took car out around 10pm Goal of seat time. e Did simple \"barrel racing\" just to practice clutch control, feel of brakes, and setting car into hairpen turn e Car cranked, ran great e Noticed car pushed more turning left than right noticeably. o Measured camber on front after outing oO Front Right +.5 oO Front Left -1 e This was also apparent on tires from picture",

Started doing the current testing. When got to IGN fuse (f10) it shorted for sum reason when putting back in and blow the PDU Trigger fuse. After that many fuses kept blowing and relays were going out. At one point turned on cooling and pdu started to smoke. Put bodges on bottom relay (pwr) pins for the fuel pump and 3/5 at Barnsvill 10:25 Loud pop, happened while testing pneumatic shifting. Bottle adapter came loose 10:50 11:00 Electrical: PDU is sparking cutting power cause backfire due to power lose. Main relay is sparking, and gets very hot, some small amount of smoke 11:36 measuring current across relay inconclusive Took pdu off Made changes to PDU to bypass the Trigger /main PDU relay made it so the SDC has the whole car pwr/amps running thu it. Before Hooking it up all the way unplugged ECU. And began testing voltage thu the pdu. Hooked up the SDC wires for car and begin to test if SDC worked. It did. Started to idle the car and the SDC fuse blew when reved really high. Did current testing on SDC it read(insert number ) and put a 30 amp fuse in there. Started to rev the car and idle it.

And put on to pdu, SDC button , and BOTS The wire was not hot anymore. Car then began to run very nicely on LV end Car log Page 79 Noticed that LV batter isn\u2019t being charged by the rectifier Later in the night IGN fuse blew (F10). 15amp to 25amp Pulled in and did current testing. (Insert value ). Added a larger fuse and ran fine after that. At one point saw a spark from where the starter is. Need to put something over it. Tuning: The car had a loud backfire but was pretty sure it was because car was rich. Could possibly be a momentarily failure in PDU. The car was reading rich in the 1k - 4k so pulled fuel out of that range by 5 percent.

This fixed spark Leak tested intake- all good While bat voltage was around 13, AFR supply zvoltage was ~11.6V. Should not be the case.

Big no no Removed this jumper, along with the black ground and the double red wire(this one was the return from the shutdown circuit. Once removed, checked the old existing shut down circuit.- Diagram shows the connections in figure 2- Could not find where the end of the loop went too. Maybe disconnected or could be problem causing from before? ? Used existing loop to wire as such in Figure 3.

Ohms Test You will need a multimeter set to Ohms for this test. Test every lead of the stator\u2019s connector and note the readings. The reading of each combination should be the same (test leads 1-2, 2-3, and 3-1). If they are different, your stator is defective. Ground",

Put the negative lead on the engine\u2019s ground and the positive lead on each wires of the stator\u2019s connector one by one. You shouldn\u2019t get a reading at all. If you get a reading, even very small, on any wire, the stator is defective and must be changed. AC Output Test Put your multimeter to AC Volts and start you vehicle. As with the Ohms test, test between each lead of the connector (1-2, 2-3, 3-1) and note the readings. They should all be the same (E.g. 20v/20v/20v). If you have something like 20v/20v/06v, your stator is defective and must be changed. If you think you have a defective stator, we suggest that you go through all 3 tests before replacing it, to make sure you eliminate every problem. From <http://statorproblems.com/15_how-to-test-a-stator.html> Should also do a current test of the whole car to make sure we did not start drawing excess current Last week we did have to replace a coil pack with the wrong size and have not checked the draw on the coils and this may be a cause.

Thursday, August 21, 2025 11:15 AM Hello New Members! Welcome to Kenesaw Motorsports! We design, build, Test, and compete with Formula 1-style race cars. Our Main shop is located in the Engineering Technology Building, on the first floor, room Q134. We have 12 sub-teams broken up into: Business/media, Aerodynamics, Composites, Frame, Vehicle Dynamics, Suspension, Driver Interfaces, Low Voltage/Wiring, Data Acquisition/Firmware, EV Powertrain, Driveline, Machining, To learn more about what each subgroup is responsible for and what we do, attend our weekly meeting on Monday @8pm in the main shop How dol join? We have a rules test to become a Member that covers some basic information regarding the technical rules surrounding our racing series. If you are only interested in",

If you are only interested in business, Graphic design, or marketing, don\u2019t worry, you'll take a non-technical rules test! What does the test go over? The technical rules test for Engineers covers sections IC, V, IN, T, F.1, F.5, D, EV.1, EV.4, and EV.5 in the rules handbook, which is located on FSAE Online under Series Resources. The test is 40 questions of mixed short answer and multiple choice. There is no need to worry about trick questions. All the questions are straightforward and are taken directly from the handbook. https://www.fsaeonline.com/cdsweb/gen/DocumentResources.aspx When and where can | take the test? The test is in person in Q134 and you may take the test whenever you have time to take it. If you have any free time between or after classes just ask in the #new-member chat if anyone is in the shop, or stop by to see if people are there. Chances are, there will be someone there to let you take the test and go over it with you afterwards! What happens if | fail the test? lf you fail the test don't panic as not everyone passes it on other first try, just study a little more and retake it. You have unlimited tries with 24 hours in between attempts, just study and retake it whenever you get the chance. Do | need any experience to join the team?

Although having experience in related fields can help you understand things more easily, you don't actually need any experience to join. Everything you need to succeed in the team you can learn here, just make sure to ask questions as that is the best way to learn. PM Page 19 What can | do to get involved? Once you pass the test just ask around, there are always projects for people with any skill level to work on. If you already know what subgroup you want to join then talking to the leads will get you started very quickly. How much time do | have to put into the team? You can put in as much or as little time as you want, but consistency is key. Consistently showing up for a few hours every week can help you learn a lot. If any of these do not answer your questions feel free to ask, there is always someone that wants to help.

Could use same tool for wheel inserts because the stock shape is the same, just different material lf we use the lathe to part it, we also need to use lathe to turn down OD to make sure it is concentric Use lathe to face one side, profile it, and then part it with the theoretical 12ft parting tool leaving more than 5-10 thou to account for parting tool deflecting Use mill to do locating feature and finish other side Machining Page 7 Big Order 1 Tools Thursday, August 14, 2025 3:28 AM Helical 4.5\" OAL 1/4\" Ball x2 Long Probe, Dove Tail Jaws, Better Manual Probe, Windex, Paper Towels, Drill Letter https://www.mscdirect.com/product/details/17733684 setkl,/ Haas 1.5\" OAL 1/8\" Ball x4 https://www.haascnc.com/haas-tooling/milling/ball end mills/03-0588.html#gsc.tab=0 Haas 1/4\"",

We weld mostly 4130 chromoly tube; chromoly has mill scale from the facturing process that needs to be removed from the top layer of welding, failure to do so will result in contamination in the weld and will make for a weaker weld b. To remove the mill scale you must use an abrasive such as the wire wheel, or scotch-brite pads. c. The metal should no longer be gray and have a nice shiny finish to it d. Your metal is now ready to weld 3. Now let's move on to aluminum a. Aluminum requires a more intensive cleaning process than steel since it is more prone to contamination within the weld. i. Most of are aluminum part are cut on the water jet and will contain garnet in the edge of the weld. Garnet will contaminate your aluminum welds and make for a more difficult weld and a weaker joint. To remove the garnet you must file down the edge of the part until shiny Now that the garnet is removed you must now clean the part with a scotch-brite pad to remove",

Once done you should wipe down the surface with acetone to remove any remaining contaminant's e. Not only will you need to wipe down the part but also the filler rod you will be using. f. Your aluminum is now ready for welding 4. In general these are the practices you should follow for the majority of the parts we weld here. While on occasion we weld different grades of steel the general procedure remains the same. While we weld more metals than just aluminum and steel the other metals will be discussed further on in the guide Torch Setup: Torches come in a wide range of sizes, shapes, and use different \"Consumables\" Consumable- Items that wear over time and you will constantly be changing/ adjusting and changing out EX...

The other one is known as a stubby gas lens. As a personal preference we have switched over to gas lenses due to a more compa ct size, This is a personal preference and some argue that Standard bodies work better. Find the one you prefer, with welding it is important to remember that there are many ways to weld so find the way in which you are comfortable. For us that means Stubby Gas Lenses. Last but definitely not least Welding Cups Welding Cups come in various shapes and sizes as well as material, above you can see a few cups that we most likely have arou nd the shop. The pink is a standard alumina cup, these are great for ac and dc welding and are usually the cheapest available cu ps, the white is a furick cup, furick cups are expensive but offer a much slimmer package they also use smaller gas lenses.

This is just step 1 of cups step 2 goes into which sizes are used for what materials, A size 4-8 is recommended for aluminum to decrease white oxidation line on material A size 8-12 is recommended for Steel and this is what is mainly used on chassis welding and tabs A size 16-18 is used for Titanium and sometimes stainless steel Keep these cups to exotic materials as they use more argon. As a rule of thumb your gas flow should be 2.5x the size of your cup size so a size 8 cup uses 20 CFM Stick-out is also based off the size of your cup, the rule of thumb here your stick-out Is cup size/ 16 in inches for a size 8 cup you should have 8/16ths or 1/2 in of stick-out. This is a rule of thumb but generally stick-out can allow you to have better visibility in most areas. In dire situations a size 18 cup will give you the most stick-out and might be necessary And know you know how to set up your torch Machine Setting There are a couple of settings that you will be changing regularly when welding such as amperage, polarity, postflow/preflow . While our machines allow to change more settings there is no real need to change them. Amperage: Amperage is the amount of \"heat\" you are putting into a part the higher the amperage the more heat you will put into a part. The general",

        "text": "the amount of \"heat\" you are putting into a part the higher the amperage the more heat you will put into a part. The general rule of thumb is to use 1 amp per thousand of an inch of material thickness. For example if you are welding a part witha thickness of .045 you should use around 45 amps. Now this rule does not have to be followed but it will give you a good start ing point of where to set amperage. As we move into more advanced joints the material thickness will vary so you will need to be able to Machining Page 27 control the foot pedal well. Soeaking of foot pedals, the foot pedal connected to the machine allows us to vary our amperage and will have a maximum amperage to what you set on the machine. As you get better at controlling the foot pedal the need to cha nge amperage on the machine will decrease as you will be able to weld most materials with the same amperage setting on the machine. Polarity: Our machines have two settings for polarity, AC and DC. DC is used to weld steel, stainless steel, titanium and various other metals. AC on the other hand is used to weld aluminum and various other metals we don\u2019t weld here. In general Dc does not have many settings you can change, on the other hand AC does; With AC you can change the frequency, balance and waveshape, well get more in depth with what each of",

Postflow/preflow: Post flow is the amount argon you will have after you finish welding. This is critical as having argon flow when done welding will prevent oxidation of the weld and will therefore make a stronger weld. Not only does this prevent oxidation of the metal but oxidation of the tungsten. Preflow is the same thing as post flow but come before an arc is struck. Pre flow will help make s ure that there are no contaminants in the air surrounding the material. Some metals don\u2019t require as much post flow as other aluminum for example does not need much post flow on the material itself but is need to cool down the tungsten, metals like titanium require larger amounts of post flow as oxide will for if the metal is not covered properly Argon/Cups Filler Material Machining Page 28 Welding plan Friday, July 14, 2023 1:12 AM Get person welding. Look for consistency in welds and them move down in thicknesses to gain more control. A consistent weld should be: Good pattern not too big of a heat affected zone. Weld should mostly penetrated, as the thickness goes down penetration should become easier and more evident in the weld.

Torch height is also important to keep consistent. Good technique with filler rod should include keeping the filler rod at a proper distance from the weld puddle and not adding an excessive amount of filler to the weld as this will lead to too tall of a weld. The weld should remain mostly flat throughout. The key step when training someone is to make sure they know why they are doing what they are doing and what changes that they are making are having an effect on their welds. If they are being inconsistent its good to ask what changes they made, were making the welds look better or worse. Sheet of a thickness that not too thick but not too thin should be used when first training a welder. .070 works well for starting some one off As the trainee becomes for comfortable with welding consider moving to tube welding. To start off have them weld tube ends together as this is more difficult to do and will help move around tube. Machining Page 29",

Because of that the mass creeped up between the car before and after the design season going way out of our projection. Although no apparent components failed throughout this mass creep, fundamentally there will be a point where if an unaccounted for mass increase of the car happens, component design will have to propagate and everything on the car will have to be increased as a result To combat this fundamental issue of the car and an attempt to control the mass to make wiser and more justified design decisions, mass tracking will be implemented incrementally throughout the design season so mass of the car does not run away with the development of the car KM Mass Track.xlsx From <https://kennesawedu.sharepoint.com/sites/Team-test ksu/ layouts/15/sharedialog.aspx?listld=30633b31-2f3f-4c37- afia-fee052f7f83c&clientlId=sharePoint&sessionld=dbbObea1-f09b-a000-039c-6e980e9fc29c&listltemld=2063 &clickTime= 1755986299999&sharingCorrelationld=59ea6e4a-034a-407f-9ea0-2890904clac6&mode=copy&ma=1 &fullScreenMode=true&itemName=KM Mass Track.xlsx&channelld=ae8ca821-5593-4393-a915-54061b41f351&origin=https% 3A%2F%2Fkennesawedu.sharepoint.com> KS9 Arch_ Page 24 Vehicle Architecture Synth Saturday, August 23, 2025 5:37 PM One night before Michelin testing, topic came up about how we were deriving lower level vehicle targets and how they were supposed to support the goals set for the overall vehicle and it's placement in competition so they don't contradict/ conflict with other vehicle goals.

The main reason is there are nearly an infinite amount of solutions for possible vehicle designs at the upper levels of the flow chart This is where defining both resource and vehicle constraints are going to be a very important thing to implement and see where that limits or improves other possible cascading design decisions. This is logic that also holds true in real world engineering application, sometimes designs overall have to cope with rigid design architectural constraints.
