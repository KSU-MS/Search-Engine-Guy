Thankfully it was only a rear wing and not a monocoque - Need to have a radio on the Ecar when its running. Potential damage to the precharge may have been prevented. Steering effort on the Ecar is fine until you reach the wall and then it becomes numb and hard to feel the car. I asked John what to do when the car continued to understeer after rear toe out and he suggested less steering angle. It was hard to find that limit due to the steering effort. In general, need more grip and easier steering - We should do an autocross test day with different",

In general, need more grip and easier steering - We should do an autocross test day with different throttle maps. I preferred linear over exponential, but maybe there’s another that feels better. - Ecar floor is very weak. I hopped into the car and the floor cracked and pulled out. Should probably be like the IC one where you can nearly stand on it. - Ecar seat isn’t stiff enough. Seat was never in the same place after removed due to it flexing and going in sideways. - Harness couldn’t get tight enough for optimal lateral support.

A dyno uses two drums to create a rolling resistance against the tires of a car. The weight and acceleration of the drums can then be used to calculate the amount of power that an engine produces. How to set up the dyno: Hopefully the first time you are trying to dyno a car someone has shown you but if not then this should help. First you need to get the WinPEP7 software off dynojet's website: [https://www.dynojet.com/downloads/dynamometer/software-firmware/](https://www.dynojet.com/downloads/dynamometer/software-firmware/) After you download that you need to go and place this config file in the Program files (x86)>WinPEP7 directory If you use the data7 (new).cfg rename it to data 7.cfg data7 (new)",

Next you need to power on those towers. Then plug the computer in. To read AFR through WinPEP7 you need to put the O2 sensor connected to the tower in the exhaust To read RPM on the software you will want to take the clamp that is also connected to the towers and clamp it around the coil wires and clamp the other on the cars ground.

First roll the car STRAIGHT on the dyno then start ratcheting back till the car is in about the middle of the drum. Then ratchet the front and back at the same time. Most importantly roll the dyno with your foot in the direction the car will turn it and ensure that the car tracks straight. This last step insures the car wont crab walk off.

Next get someone in the car and wearing the proper equipment (full racing suit, shoes, helmet, gloves, etc). Once the driver gets the wheels turning give them a signal to give it the beans. When you give this signal press the green button on the control connected to the towers to start a sample. They will need to make sure to give it full throttle.

The model is designed to fit in the aero box, avoid collisions with steering and control arm droop, allow some space for possible anti-roll bar(s), and allow iteration in CFD.

This model needs ride height studies along with inlet/outlet studies. Another point of interest is feed and interaction from the front wing. One point of interest on this design is the theory that curvature might help allow a smoother flow but this is unproven. We are also interested in the possibility of adding winglets to the back of the diffuser as well as strakes underneath the car and the effect they would have. We will later consider studying the effects of front wing vortex generators and how they may help maintain undertray downforce. Other important studies might include roll, pitch, and yaw studies as the undertray is sensitive to all 3 of these conditions. Concept B This concept has",

It includes 3 sections but no curvature for more simplicity. It also includes strakes and a Nolder NX along the trailing edge of the diffuser section. One idea we had was to extend the section between the wheels and the chassis to have a 2 [nd] smaller inlet that feeds from approximately where the front wing is through under the control arms and into the main undertray where its flow combines with the existing intake. One thing to note is we don’t know if the outer section will see any air. Aero Page 36 Aero Page 37 Aero Page",

Cannot adjust pot on VCU anymore because of the comparator issue. Vmax=Vcc-1.5V, so max setting is 3.71V and thus the pedal trips sooner in the travel range. Brake bleed was poor, which means resting the foot on the pedal or slight presses would trigger BSPD. A better bleed would help this by firming up the pedal, effectively pushing the trip point further back. Rotating the pot could be possible as well, but adjustment is still lacking. **Brakes are squishy and fluid was boiling off of rotors** Rotors are dirty from brake flush- clean them and don't let fluid get everywhere when bleeding brakes, and please don't contaminate the pads Pedal is squishy- get a better bleed All of the above issues",

The KS5c body was designed to be as close to one piece as possible. It includes the nose, the top of the car, and some of the sides. The design was done with surface modeling around the frame and components of the car. The mold was decided to be made from insulation foam paneling. This mold will end up being very large, and if it was made from MDF, it would weigh around 200lbs. And I don't think you want to be lugging around a 200lb mold.

It could also be done as two negative mold halves to make the surface finish a lot cleaner right off the bat, but that would require more foam and it would also end up being very difficult to layup the carbon inside the mold (unless you have 5 foot long arms??). Step 1: Machined foam BJ machined 7 individual stacks of foam on Architecture's 5-axis Onsrud CNC mill. This was done because the length of the bit is only so long.

We used the same glue that was used to initially glue up the layers. It is a specialty spray adhesive made for foam. (3M 78 for Insulation and Polystyrene) As always, make sure you weigh down your parts that are gluing up. Step 3: Initial Foam Prep Sometimes the machine will mess up and leave marks or take chunks out of the part. The controller software sometimes gets confused and will just drop the bit into your pretty part. We don't know why, but it happens.

Once it is dry, rough sand the whole thing to start to get the surface closer to being smooth. 100 grit works well for this. Think of it like sculpting. Main goal is to get it close to the final shape you want.

This is also a good time to start planing your ply schedule and what I call, \"maps.\" The \"maps\" are the individual templates for each piece that you'll put on. Since for a complex shape like this, you can't just cover it in one single piece. Either the shape is too complex and requires a computer software to \"unfold\" the 3d shape into a 2d template, or you just can't fit the whole thing onto one piece of carbon/glass (since rolls are only 40\" or 50\" wide).

The resin used can be either the regular epoxy resin we use for layups, or fiberglass resin. The fiberglass resin is a bit cheaper however, so go with that.

When all epoxy resins dry in open air and exposed to moisture, it will form what is called an amine blush. It is a reaction that happens when the curing resin mixes with moisture in the air. Normally, when under vacuum, there is no air or moisture for it to react with. However, when doing this fiberglass shell, or any other repairs involving epoxy resin, an amine layer will form. It will create this sticky, oily, coating that will make it feel like it is permanently wet. This can be reduced by covering the resin with release film/peel-ply. This way the amine layer will hopefully form on the fabric, instead of your part. You can then remove the peel-ply afterwards. The",

This way the amine layer will hopefully form on the fabric, instead of your part. You can then remove the peel-ply afterwards. The amine layer can create a few problems. First, it will make subsequent layers of resin, paint, adhesive, etc. not bond properly to the surface. Second, it will clog up your sandpaper within seconds if you try to sand the surface. And we will be doing a lot of sanding on this mold. Luckily, it is fairly easy to remove. Soapy water and a Scotch-brit pad will make quick work of it. And a little left will not clog your sandpaper as quickly if there was a full layer.

Then narrow it down to ones that can bond to carbon, and aluminum, since it will be used on both. How strong does it need to be.

Ohms Test You will need a multimeter set to Ohms for this test. Test every lead of the stator’s connector and note the readings. The reading of each combination should be the same (test leads 1-2, 2-3, and 3-1). If they are different, your stator is defective. Ground Test Set your multimeter",

Put the negative lead on the engine’s ground and the positive lead on each wires of the stator’s connector one by one. You shouldn’t get a reading at all. If you get a reading, even very small, on any wire, the stator is defective and must be changed. AC Output Test Put your multimeter to AC Volts and start you vehicle. As with the Ohms test, test between each lead of the connector (1-2, 2-3, 3-1) and note the readings. They should all be the same (E.g. 20v/20v/20v).

If you are only interested in business, Graphic design, or marketing, don’t worry, you'll take a non-technical rules test! What does the test go over? The technical rules test for Engineers covers sections IC, V, IN, T, F.1, F.5, D, EV.1, EV.4, and EV.5 in the rules handbook, which is located on FSAE Online under Series Resources. The test is 40 questions of mixed short answer and multiple choice. There is no need to worry about trick questions. All the questions are straightforward and are taken directly from the handbook. [https://www.fsaeonline.com/cdsweb/gen/DocumentResources.aspx](https://www.fsaeonline.com/cdsweb/gen/DocumentResources.aspx) When and where can I take the test?

Everything you need to succeed in the team you can learn here, just make sure to ask questions as that is the best way to learn. PM Page 19 What can I do to get involved?

You can put in as much or as little time as you want, but consistency is key. Consistently showing up for a few hours every week can help you learn a lot. If any of these do not answer your questions feel free to ask, there is always someone that wants to help.

This is critical as having argon flow when done welding will prevent oxidation of the weld and will therefore make a stronger weld. Not only does this prevent oxidation of the metal but oxidation of the tungsten. Preflow is the same thing as post flow but come before an arc is struck. Pre flow will help make sure that there are no contaminants in the air surrounding the material. Some metals don’t require as much post flow as other aluminum for example does not need much post",

Because of that the mass creeped up between the car before and after the design season going way out of our projection. Although no apparent components failed throughout this mass creep, fundamentally there will be a point where if an unaccounted for mass increase of the car happens, component design will have to propagate and everything on the car will have to be increased as a result To combat this fundamental issue of the car and an attempt to control the mass to make wiser and more justified design decisions, mass tracking will be implemented incrementally throughout the design season so mass of the car does not run away with the development of the car [KM_Mass_Track.xlsx](https://kennesawedu.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/Team-test_ksu/Shared%20Documents/General/02_Car%20%26%20Team%20Goals/04_Miscellaneous/KM_Mass_Track.xlsx?d=w5d51413debeb4d6b91b53f8a01632322&csf=1&web=1&e=bnMRtK) [From <https://kennesawedu.sharepoint.com/sites/Team-test_ksu/_layouts/15/sharedialog.aspx?listId=30633b31-2f3f-4c37-](https://kennesawedu.sharepoint.com/sites/Team-test_ksu/_layouts/15/sharedialog.aspx?listId=30633b31-2f3f-4c37-af1a-fee052f7f83c&clientId=sharePoint&sessionId=dbb0bea1-f09b-a000-039c-6e980e9fc29c&listItemId=2063&clickTime=1755986299999&sharingCorrelationId=59ea6e4a-034a-407f-9ea0-2890904c1ac6&mode=copy&ma=1&fullScreenMode=true&itemName=KM_Mass_Track.xlsx&channelId=ae8ca821-5593-4393-a915-54061b41f351&origin=https%3A%2F%2Fkennesawedu.sharepoint.com)",

Sunday, June 29, 2025 7:10 PM This page is under construction btw lol, some descriptions are a little long Also this is \"heavily inspired\" by Val's welcome page from last year # W e l c o m e to the Low Voltage subgroup! **What we make on the car:** ##### Wire harnesses + connectors **Low voltage wire harnesses distribute power and communications to various devices and sensors across the car.** Our low voltage system is powered by 12 volts DC, and our devices communicate through the CAN protocol. To make our harness modular, we commonly use two main types of \"Deutsch\" connectors, Deutsch (DT) and Deutsch Mini (DTM). ##### Control circuit design **Develop the logic behind circuits that control vehicle function.** One good example would be our Vehicle Control Unit, which requires the Brake System Plausibility Device (BSPD) per FSAE rules.

The BSPD is a critical device that monitors brake position and throttle position. If it detects the driver is pressing both petals simultaneously past a certain threshold, it shuts down the motor. This is in case of a stuck throttle. Per rules, this cannot be done using code, so clever use of electrical logic gates are used in our VCU. ##### PCB design and soldering **To bring our circuit design into a robust, compact form, we design custom PCBs using Altium Designe** r (will go over how to access Altium student license during an LV class).

To reduce costs, all of our boards are **assembled and soldered by hand.** ##### Work with Data Acquisition (to make their wishes come true) Data acquisition requires readings from multiple sensors across the car in real time. While DAQ deals with how to obtain and interpret the data using firmware, our low voltage subgroup deals with **how to integrate these necessary sensors into our wiring.** \"Per Formula SAE rules, any electrical system within the car that operates with **less than 60 volts** is considered low voltage.

This is so if one of these switches is latched (and therefore disconnects), the entire \"shut down circuit loop\" is disconnected. Our shut down circuit is defined with a purple wire. This creates a very robust shut down system. ##### Tractive Control Unit (TCU) Controls the isolation relays, which connect and disconnect the high voltage battery from the rest",

If a cell reaches too high of a temperature, or the IMD detects insufficient isolation between high voltage and the chassis, the ACU will disconnect our shutdown circuit (SDC), shutting off the TCU.

Running theory is that there was a short from the MAX7480ESA to the output of the LM2904. Due to propagation delay and a much smaller parasitic capacitance on the output of the LM2904 vs its VCC pin, it likely experienced a brief backfeed of current into its output pin, causing a runaway event as the op-amp attempts to correct its output. **\"The pedal potentiometers were questionable and were replaced shortly after \"** This theory relies on the floating GND of the 5v LDO, the MAX7480ESA and the LM2904 experience an internal short, and the PTC fuse being too slow.

Since this issue happened the day before we were leaving for a shootout event, we had to complete many of these fixes at the shootout event. When running through an EV active inspection, we first learned that the BSPD circuit was no longer functioning.

The Teensy has no way to tell if that data is legit or not due to SPI’s simplicity, but I have not confirmed this with the MCP library.

The budget was determined based on testing of the KS8. During an endurance style test, the KS8 achieved 268 Wh/km energy consumption with the Aero on. This is the upper limit of endurance energy usage with a 15% buffer. So long as the aero package does not exceed this target, the car will have enough energy to complete endurance without needing to conserve energy through throttle discipline.

Tire tractive force can be broken down to the following basic friction equation: That is, the lateral force is equal to the product of the tires friction coefficient and the normal force acting on the tire. It is clear that by increasing the normal force on the tire you will linearly increase lateral acceleration potential, which is related to velocity by: Therefore, using substitution, velocity is",

Drag acts directly against accelerating force, so a vehicle with a large aero package (and lots of drag) will accelerate slower than a vehicle without (this is what defined early race car design philosophy). The nuance here comes from incorporating downforce. Faster cornering speeds means corner exit speed is higher than a non-aero car, and the aero car generally covers the straight distance quicker than a non-aero car, that is if the downforce benefits outweigh the drag. We’ll come back to this point. Since drag is a force that is applied over time, it can be defined as work the car is producing and therefore requires energy to sustain.

This has a _huge_ impact on efficiency points, and is more impactful on points than the time loss from isolated drag effects. Coming back to that point about drag outweighing downforce, it is important to identify how much drag you are willing to accept for the amount of downforce you are generating, or the other way around. In this consideration, it is more important to consider the energy effects of drag than the lap time effects because of the nature of FSAE Electrics low energy density powertrains and efficiency scoring.

The goal was to see how these changes affected overall downforce at the component level. Each component went through iterations using the neighboring KS8 components (Undertray, or UT, would use KS8 Rear Wing, or RW, and Front Wing, or FW, throughout its iterations) to isolate component change effects on itself and the system. This was done to avoid complexity of adding in the other component iterations at each step",

This was done to avoid complexity of adding in the other component iterations at each step and quicken the iterative process. To re-iterate, we were looking at large changes and avoiding small interactions. The most important conceptual decisions that will begin the feasibility & fine tuning phase are as follows: Starting from the front of the car moving rearwards, the front wing will focus on a shorter \"split\" mainplane that has a better pressure to surface area ratio. It will avoid implementing complex geometry for tire wash/UT flow control due to the added complexity outweighing the observed effects, and will instead rely on whole wing camber tuning and \"whisker\" elements to condition downstream air to the UT and RW.

The UT will focus on a mid-car placement between the wheels with airfoil shaped, stacked element side tunnels. A flat bottom will bridge the two side tunnels that provides clean air to the bottom of the car. The RW will focus on a 3 element profile that has a lofted feature in the middle. The 3 elements allow for easier DRS implementation as it reduces the movable flaps to 2 instead of 3. The central loft increases the camber and reduces angle of incidence with the air, allowing the RW to access free stream flow coming from above the drivers head.

The next phase uses the best concept of each component and combines them to focus on intricate fine tuning with hard constraints from manufacturability, assembly, mounting, and whole car integration (radiator, jacking bar, chassis changes, etc.) FW Executive Summary The goal of FW development is to improve from KS8.

The KS8 front wing suffered from flow separation on upper elements, low camber airfoils, ineffective EP vortex generators, and integration issues regarding jacking point access. 2D airfoil simulations identified that higher camber increased downforce over flat airfoils at the most optimal ground height for ground effect (about 2 inches at a chord of 18 in, or 1/9 the length of the chord), showing this as a dominant trait. It was also discovered that single elements (mainplanes) would separate flow on the bottom side towards the trailing edge unless a stacked element was placed behind. Furthermore, the mainplane could be \"split\" into two airfoils to increase the surface area in which there was low pressure and reduce the area that was ambient, making it more efficient at producing downforce for its surface area and therefore weight.",

For this design im having trouble figuring out whether or not that stud and heatset interaction also would require positive locking. As well as the concern of heatsets generally being pretty weak to rotational force, and the studs would need to grow a significant amount in diameter to account for that hex feature.

So it was between these options and the making our own (we never planned on doing this). We had reliability issues with the bamocar with our 300V car where it blew the Switches above 39 kW. So that left the cascadia options CM200dz (only 600V option without crazy oversize) or the DTI 550 or 850. We ran with the cm200 as we got the used model way cheaper that the normal price (3500 instead of 7100) which was also cheaper than both DTI models (I think 5500 and 6500).

This sample was made but never tested due to constraints on being able to use the MTS lab. **Design Considerations** We originally set out to make a half-monocoque chassis for the IC car.

The idea was to do a uniform layup meaning one continuous ply schedule that would pass the strict rule for side-impact everywhere on the car. Based on my predictions, this conservative design would be within 4 lbs of one of our full-tube frames. (~ 60 lbs +-4).

It would be easier to design and build for the first iteration. (We would have also had enough expired carbon for this). In 2024, the IC is phasing out and the EV is phasing in.

The ones where the monocoque is one piece will require multiple molds that mate together with a very small seam before being layed up on. This will usually create a 'flash line' where resin will fill. This can usually be easily knocked off. For a half-coque, this will usually mean 2 molds and for a full monocoque, it may be 3-5 molds (sometimes still 2). Another question that arises from this is \"Where do I put the split?\".

This would allow the CNC router to make the bottom mold/part in one shot and maintain higher symmetry for the suspension. The top half of the monocoque would be less critical but still has to mate well with the bottom. For a pre-preg process, I would make the monocoque in one piece if the geometry is possible. This way you do not have to rely on a bond. However, for a resin infused process, 2 parts would be required to be bonded together. **Resin Infused vs Pre-Preg vs Cut-and-Fold** With wet-layup not being possible, these are the three options.

These are the existing processes because they are not very time constrained manufacturing wise like a 2hour wet-layup is. Resin infusion was not considered since the team did not have experience in it however, resin infusion may be cheaper than pre-preg because pre-preg would require high-temp mold materials. The cut-and-fold process is the idea of using a pre-fabricated sandwich panel, routing contours in the flat sheet, folding it to the desired shape, and bonding it together.

Conversely, you could technically get away with committing to a multi-piece-bonded-together monocoque and use high-temp tooling block, but that is also crazy expensive. Another take is to do an aluminum sheet metal mold. This will require minimal surface prep (really nice) but will heavily constrain the design based on how sheet metal can be bent. You may be able to weld multiple pieces together. You will save time on the mold and might save money. It however be hard to hit",

You will save time on the mold and might save money. It however be hard to hit the correct bending tolerances. For the 'plug', cheap foam or MDF may be used but MDF will likely have way more dimensional accuracy despite costing more. It will also be less fragile and have less moldprep involved. **Core Materials** We went with Aramid-Nomex honeycomb because it was cheap and we also had it, I see no need to change this. The primary goal is to get thickness to the part without adding weight. If a higher adhesion between core and skin is required, a better adhesive sheet, or higher cell density may be useful.

If resin infusion is the chosen route, a foam compatible with it will be required. **Shape** A more square XY profile (Cut section parallel with front plane) may be easier to layup however, a more round (octagonal, filleted, or circular) profile will be torsionally and locally stiffer. In general, keep the geometry simple to save manufacturing headache. Also, flatter regions are easier to mate to.

The rules will be constraint #1, packaging # 2. Work with the chassis, suspension, powertrain, and aero leads especially. **Inserts/Bolted Connections** I am no expert on this but a couple different options are hard aluminum or plastic inserts placed in the layup, thru hole with sized washers/nut plates, and potted inserts (such as a NAS-1834-4-1000). On non-torqued parts, it may be recommended to fill the surrounding honeycomb with epoxy or use a hard insert in case the bolt moves and damages the surrounding core. **Core Crushing** This is an issue I have read up",

You should generally not be concerned about an autoclave crushing the face of the honeycomb. **Cost** Yet to input the breakdown in a clean way but expect $6-8k for a first iteration.
