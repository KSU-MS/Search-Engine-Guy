Thankfully it was only a rear wing and not a monocoque Need to have a radio on the Ecar when its running. Potential damage to the precharge may have been prevented. Steering effort on the Ecar is fine until you reach the wall and then it becomes numb and hard to feel the car. | asked John what to do when the car continued to understeer after rear toe out and he suggested less steering angle. It was hard to find that limit due to the steering effort. In general, need more grip and easier steering We should do an autocross test day with different throttle maps. | preferred linear over exponential, but maybe there’s another that feels better. Ecar floor is very weak. | hopped into the car and the floor cracked and pulled out. Should probably be like the IC one where you can nearly stand on it. Ecar seat isn’t stiff enough. Seat was never in the same place after removed due to it flexing and going in sideways.

Intake should be as reliable as currently, if going to carbon.. prove it is as tough Fuel injector data is def worth getting. Set up test rig, test. Also to find deadband, decrease PW until hardly any fuel comes out Need to look into calculating AFR targets better. Also test, so lots of dyno work seeing which afr is best suited. Different tunes for events. IE eco mode for endurance Have actual tests to test to for reliability, IE cranking less than 2 seconds, idle less than 1500 rpm, etc. More tuning work. Have car up to temp, this should be the baseline. Then work backwards to adjust WUE AE and such accordingly Log headers help with sound Closed loop fuel is good, but takes some work to have it not be a pain Solve for gearing, need diff final drive. Take gear curves, along with torque curve and match the two. Not using other 4 gears is very inefficient. More math for cooling system Dry sump can be good, but balance weight and CG, judge thought less weight is better than lower CG to an extent. Test more shift times, improve and know the shift time.

Having the constant tech sheets really helped us pass mechanical tech relatively easy Even though acc got finished last minute, good job on passing accumulator tech. Design Putting the accumulator in seemed clunky and cumbersome Need to ensure the front end of the chassis is the same as the 5 if we are gonna use the same front wing. This one was shorter and thus made the wing illegal with the old mounts. o Need to come up with a better way to jig the welded mounts to reduce any alignment issues there. Judges still don’t like how taller people fit in the car due to the pedals. Need to make sure the body mold is symmetrical Aero wise, we think the judges prefer the May version of the design presentation instead of the honest version.

The process where the teams will be doing presentations in front of the Student Outreach Committee will take into consideration your unspent funds from FY22. We certainly appreciate how our student competition teams worked with us as we finalized staffing for processing orders. It is Dr.Laureano’s expectation that our reconciliation of funds, transparency with the teams, and effectiveness in the processes remain our priority and for that effort we are beginning the conversations that will help us accelerate the funding request process while still allowing the competition teams to spend their FY22 remaining funds once the new fiscal year begins. Please remember as we are approaching year end process for the university, spending for this fiscal year and year end processes must be followed by us and thus we will need your assistance in prioritizing those items needed for your upcoming competitions. To these points specifically: e Will P Card limits be raised to compensate for the intended removal of rollover?

Decisions on how to proceed with funding is based on how the teams are spending their funds and what rules govern funding sources. For example, we know that KSU Foundation allocates a certain amount of funds for each fiscal year which is where the funding requests you are all approved to receive come from, and thus what we are trying to do is ensure that we are spending what we have been allocated first.

You continue: \"The process where the teams will be doing presentations in front of the Student Outreach Committee will take into consideration your unspent funds from FY22.\" e Last year, we were personally assured that unspent funds would not be taken into account for Student Presentations. Are you stating that the Student Outreach Committee will penalize Competition Teams who successfully come under-budget, rather than spending the entire allocation; or is the opposite true, where spending the entire allocation for the fiscal year is deemed undesirable compared to careful budgeting? e Why is this change being made?

We took the current cars practice times dilled in after comp to a standard deviation of .02 and projected where that car could place. This info allowed us to project in our ranked priority change list what changes were most necessary for advancement and what could be achieved in our budget. In our plotting of the 22 season a placement within 125% of winning time would prove to be a top 15 finish in dynamics. As seen in the box and whiskers plots. Given our points mass model we developed a change list of critical car parameters to meet in the new iteration. Our goals are much more centered on getting a car no only through tech but also in the 125% to score points in each event. Short: Analsys of 22 results Charcitersation of current car.

A dyno uses two drums to create a rolling resistance against the tires of a car. The weight and acceleration of the drums can then be used to calculate the amount of power that an engine produces. How to set up the dyno: Hopefully the first time you are trying to dyno a car someone has shown you but if not then this should help. First you need to get the WinPEP7 software off dynojet's website: https://www.dynojet.com/downloads/dynamometer/software-firmware After you download that you need to go and place this config file in the Program files (x86)>WinPEP7 directory If you use the data7 (new).cfg rename it to data 7.cfg data7 (new) _| data7 This will allow your computer to connect with the towers that power some of the dyno components. Next you need to power on those towers. Then plug the computer in. To read AFR through WinPEP7 you need to put the O2 sensor connected to the tower in the exhaust To read RPM on the software you will want to take the clamp that is also connected to the towers and clamp it around the coil wires and clamp the other on the cars ground. Putting a car on the dyno: This should seem easy but if you mess up it would be a real bad",

    "text": "on the cars ground. Putting a car on the dyno: This should seem easy but if you mess up it would be a real bad day. First roll the car STRAIGHT on the dyno then start ratcheting back till the car is in about the middle of the drum. Then ratchet the front and back at the same time. Most importantly roll the dyno with your foot in the direction the car will turn it and ensure that the car tracks straight. This last step insures the car wont crab walk off. Getting a graph: Make sure no one is around the tires or behind the dyno and that the exhaust gasses have proper ventilation. The driver also needs to understand that he should not slam on the breaks after the run to eliminate extra stress on the straps. Next get someone in the car and wearing the proper equipment (full racing suit, shoes, helmet, gloves, etc). Once the driver gets the wheels turning give them a signal to give it the beans. When you give this signal press the green button on the control connected to the towers to start a sample. They will need to make sure to give it full throttle. The most accurate results will be the gear ratio closet to 1:1. However, you can rip through all the gears if you want. After the driver hits redline or lets off press the green button to end the sample. The graph will then be displayed on the laptop and saved in the",

The previous style of run is a normal dyno that gives an accurate dyno graph The other kind of run you can do is steady state. This run will just put load on the engine with the brake and keep the engine at a specific RPM allowing for more tuning precision. ADDED 12-16-22 The load can be enabled through the pendent by holding the green button while rolling. The amount can then be set in the software by either the value in the bottom left, or by dragging the white arrow on the outside of the load gauge.

This also helps insure that you are achieving a good volumetric efficiency (VE) How to tune The ECU uses a software called tuner studio. This software has a premium version to allow for some auto tune features | will get into later. First there are a few things you should check. What is the firing order for that engine. What is the size of the fuel injectors and engine. What is the redline set at and how comfortable are you with the current tune if you are unsure bring the redline down anyways. What is",

What is the trigger wheel settings for that engine and is there any reason those would be wrong What timing are you on for an initial startup try running a fixed timing instead of the table Do you have a cam, map, TPS, or O2 sensor. Are the injectors and coils in the right order (check this with the test mode) Are your sensors calibrated correctly do those values make sense for what the car is doing when not running. If the engine is not hitting check to see if the cam and crank are logging in the high speed logger. Tuning fundamentals Once the car is running you should check your AFR (air to fuel ratio) if this is not within 12.7-14.8 after warming up you should adjust the VE table until the AFR is within those ranges. (this can be done with auto tune). After this you will want to let the car cool down and see if the WUE (warm up enrichment) looks like a gradual slope and that the AFR offset goals look adequate. Assuming you are running a fixed timing you will want to start implementing the timing table. You will have to make an educated guess on what the timing should be and keep bellow 6k until the timing values are worked out well. After that you will want to up the rev limit 1k at a",

To start you will want to duplicate the timing from the column to the left to the new column. Then edit according to sound again. At some point you will need to stop and get nock sensors because once you can here the knock something is already damaged. So progress at your own risk and level of knowledge. More advanced tuning Run the car with sequential injection and spark, this will require a CAM sensor so the ECU know the exact events to do these rather than just wasted spark and fuel. To achieve more accuracy you should also run the car off the MAP (mass airflow pressure) this will tell the ECU exactly how much air it can get rather than how open the throttle is. The AFR will very per each cylinder so at some point you should put an O2 in each runner. Engine and Drivetrain Page 12 Jesse D.

(update as of 2/28/2023, this should not be a \"assumed\" 24900hm pullup as the curve is different with different resistor values.

The following logs were taken while figuring out the dyno brake and other factors. The first log, On, has a recorded event of the burst place popping near the end of the log at the small RPM spike. The final log, On3, is the final and actual test run we conducted. We were able to get 57.6 seconds into the test under 100% TPS before the muffler started shooting sparks/cat material all over dyno, and then the test was stopped. The video below shows the aftermath of the muffler immediately after. The current theory is the built in cat in the muffler got super heated and started burning. It may have been possible to continue running, but it was decided to stop the run. With such a short run time, the test is inconclusive and thus the oil cooler should be kept on until further testing is done. The oil temps did reach 210°F by the end of the 57.6 seconds, with coolant at 225°F, however this does not mean too much as the CLT temps were still higher than the oil, and thus the oil was still coming up to temperature.

This marks the end of Headers testing on ETS. (mph) Final notes on test: The VEAL and afr aspect of the test was negated as there were no mufflers which would fit each set of headers. The sound recording was omitted as each header went beyond the limits of the sound meter's measuring device. Data was collected on the two sets of headers, with the second set of headers only having one run. We attempted to test the log, but the reinforced mounts we added prevented the headers from being mounted. All in all, some useful data was collected from the runs and can be used to design the new sets of headers. It would have been good to test more sets of headers, but considering the situation of the test we are satisfied with the testing.

Does it have manageable power delivery? This category focuses on design of the drive management systems, motor(s), accumulators and drivel ine. Where appropriate, understanding of failure modes and critical limp-home requirements should be addressed. Teams should demonstrate competent and reasonable analysis methods, appropriate physical execution, and validation within their design. Sample areas include, but are not limited to: o Are the benefits of electric motors fully utilized (e.g. over powering/boosting, regenerative braking, vehicle control)? o Is the system well packaged/integrated into the remainder of the vehicle? oO Has a good balance of Make vs. Buy decisions been employed? o Were motor(s) appropriately selected and developed? Does the team have a good insight in the limitations of their motor(s) and the trade-offs on weight and energy efficiency? o Which power/torque ratio is chosen? Are the reasons for this understood? o Are cooling systems properly sized for the motor, battery, electronics, accumulator, etc...? o Is the accumulator configuration properly designed to meet the team's stated goals? (e.g. capacity, power, temperature dependence) o Is an energy management strategy clearly defined and implemented? o Temperature management: which are the weakest components and under which conditions?

This was done by writing some code to control either relay with a serial port input to the teensy, and both worked well. After the missing parts were acquired, the board was fully populated then powered on. There were a few things wrong e The isolated 12v supply was sitting around 1.4V. After reboots it would still be significantly under voltage © This was due to the 2904 op-amp making a ~250 ohm short across Iso12v+/- o After connected the iso side to the bench 12v, it blew up the op amp and that’s how | found out it was the problem O The onboard supply was going into over current state because of the short and shutting down to protect itself e Acomponent was getting warm on the tractive system side O This was likely the op amp O | noticed smoke at one point as well e The V-F converters weren't working oO At first, this was due to placing them",

Checked the following at each freq. generator chips and got following: iso 12v- same, 11.9V Pin 6 on chip (netC11/C6) and got the same 209mV RC1/2, and got different readings- Compared RC1/2 at 1V on TP5/6 RC2-0.77V RC1- 0.38V At 2V RC2-1.17V RC1- 0.69V At 3V RC2- 1.56V RC1- 1.00V At 6V RC2- 2.74V RC1- 1.92V RC1 is Acc Freq, the one which is behaving correctly. This shows that the reading should be roughly a 1/3 of input voltage on TP5/6. The RC2 is not behaving correctly, and is more like 2/5ths or some shit like that Imao So voltage diff between the two, and then compared right before and after the resistors for both- the resistors is where the discrepancy is occurring.

The LM33/7L is easy to use and requires only two extemal resistors to set the output voltage. Both line and load regulation are better than standard fixed regulators. The LM337L ts packaged in a standard, easy-to-use TO-92 transistor package. In addition to higher performance than fixed regulators, the LM337L offers full overload protection.

Place the Nyback diode at the DRV103 end when driving long (inductive) cables to a remotely located load, This minimizes RFI EMIE and helps protect the output DMOS transistor from breakdown caused by dl/dt transients, Fast rectifier diodes such as epitaxial silioon or Schottky types are recommended as flyback diodes Screenshot from video posted of test circuit working added 8/1/23 JS DR TOS Busi Cincmit Cormeen.

Develop engagement survey for sponsors (Brittanie) Syltech Sponsor Email Good morning, My name is Steven Tubbs, and | am reaching out on behalf of Kennesaw Motorsports. We are a Collegiate Formula SAE team from Kennesaw, Georgia, USA. We have been looking for a new suite of sensors to use on our Internal Combustion (IC) car and came across your sensor lineup. The native use of DTM connectors on your sensors stood out, as we currently utilize the Deutsch lineup to construct the wiring harness for our cars. Having the connector built directly into the sensor housing would allow us to simplify our wiring and decrease the number of failure points in our system. Other combination sensors are sold on the market, but none complement our needs better than yours. We would love to partner with you and bring light to your lineup in our competition series and across the United States. Let me know if we can work something out! Sincerely, Steven Tubbs Include percentile of teams performance, put our performance in context Elaborate more into the “impression” of the exposure the sponsor would get from sponsoring our team Overall provide more material to our sponsors and more in depth analysis and context as to what",

Solution: The non-traditional work model allows our employees to spend more time doing what they love (racing). This makes them more efficient and reduces the carbon footprint because of the significant decrease in commuting workers. 4. The products created by these tightknit, specialized groups can be marketed as more craftsman - like products 5.

Supply Chain changes c. Charger Infrastructure 5. Transition to Labor Force (Insert Name Here) PWNER Labor Force: 1. Cause: Pandemic limited traditional work environments Effect: Non-traditional work environments took an upwards climb 3. Solution: The non-traditional work model allows our employees to spend more time doing what they love (racing). This makes them more efficient and reduces the carbon footprint because of the significant decrease in commuting workers. 4. The products created by these tightknit, specialized groups can be marketed as more craftsman- like products 5. To connect with the customers empathetic side, we can advertise the college scholarship and carrier pathways offered in our company 6. Talk about how college scholarship and carrier pathways help increase worker retention by offering more relatable benefits in a highly volatile labor market 7. Use volatility of the labor market to transition to the unstable economy and supply chain 8. Needs: Labor hours per vehicle (2500hrs?), update the tenure N Ladder Incentive pathway enourages employee development and growth increasing employee tenure B66y using this method we can keep our market charged with our vehicles To keep our vehicles on road we have a robust plan for Charger infrastructure Supply chain changes 1.

Our company should take a sustainable approach to developing a vehicle powered by a different power source. We should aim to reduce the carbon footprint of the vehicle, minimize waste, and ensure that the materials used in the vehicle's production are environmentally friendly. This will involve conducting a comprehensive environmental impact assessment of the new power source and adopting sustainable practices throughout the production process. Supply Chain Issues: The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of resilient supply chains. The new power source must be supported by a robust global supply chain that can withstand any disruptions. This will involve diversifying suppliers and reducing reliance on a single source. We should consider sourcing materials locally, and we should also identify alternative suppliers to ensure that we can continue production in the event of a supply chain disruption.

Intro and Flow: e Focus on storytelling. Abri had a good flow mentioned a week or so ago. Stick to that, then add some conversational transitions, and build your points and slides to climax at your Product Differentiation (what makes you better than the competitors). Implementation and the appendix should support how that differentiation will actually be created and why it makes your customers care (and your competition sweat). e Anote on flow: there's no right answer. It really doesn't matter if you go Intro>customer>product >marketing strategy> implementation or intro>product>customer>competition>marketing strategy/implementation.

You can also introduce the competition here. These two sections are closely intertwined. O. Climax = what makes our offering different from the competition (in business terms, this is your product differentiation and competitive advantage). Explain how your product resolves the customer pain point or solves their problem. Show how you do this better than the competition.

The profit margin for a lux car is typically 10-20k per car, meaning if the car sells for 500,000 than the cost is close to 485,000 ii. Lower end cars have relatively the same margins https://www.carscoops.com/2022/02/how-does-an-f1-team-spend-450-million-in-a-year-and-still-make-a-profit i. Formula cars on the other hand tend to only make a 10-40 million profit and spend up to 450 million, however this does not include the revues pulled in by the team being in formula one and the marketing it brings to the company b. What kind of race cars are most popular? Why? https://motorracingsports.com/what-are-the-most-popular-motorsports-in-the-world i. For actual race cars, Formula One is the most viewed race with roughly 87 million, next being Nascar at 12 million, and Moto@ getting 3 million, and lastly Indy car. The first and second link below (Ci. & C ii.) i. However, in the lux car scene, as previously stated, SUV's are seen to be the most popular ii. And features matter more than c.

(This is important especially since using recycled materials is one of your points.) If not many people recycle, why is this? How can you incentivize them do more? © Examples: Recycling: Redwood Materials and Tesla/Ford/Volvo; Repurpose Energy How do consumers get the packs to the recyclers? Where does your company fall in this supply chain? If refiners are the bottleneck, how much do they produce annually? Is that enough to sustain your current and projected demand? If not, are there any alternatives? To dive extra deep, take a look at the geographical region of the raw materials sources and refiners locations. Why are they there? What characteristics does that place have that other places don't have? Is there anything they lack that you could provide to them? Is there any way you can leverage that knowledge when choosing partners or negotiating resources? © Geographic Sources of these materials: https://elements.visualcapitalist.com/ranked- top-25-nations-for-battery-metals/ Supply Chain Trends: Increased automation technology Influence and implementation of Al and augmented reality “mineral market\" leaders in refinement and extraction US government involvement in mineral market and \"critical minerals\" © https://www.usgs.gov/news/national-news-release/us-geological-survey-releases-2022-list- critical-minerals Trends in the Energy Market in general (other products that use the same raw materials as EV lithium-ion batteries) ©. https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy- transitions/mineral-requirements-for-clean-energy-transitions Circular Economy General Research: EV (lithium-ion battery) Supply Chain Basics: https: rmi.org/ev-batteries-101-supply-chains www.nrdc.org/bio/jordan-brinn/electric-vehicle-battery-supply-chains-basics lronic: \"As a result, the metals mining industry is the largest single",

In 2013 (because of declining availability of engine parts) we announced the Spec Racer® Ford Gen3 (1.6 Liter Ford Sigma motor) under the supervision of Technical Director Mike Davies.

For tubes and parts with small internal volumes that we do not care about the flow around like the chassis tubes simply make them a solid body and merge them together. This will reduce the amount of cells required ad reduce the mesh complexity. Importing models: There are a few methods to import models. There are three different import options. Import in to 3d- CAD model, import mesh, and import CAE Model. Because we are using STAR CCM+ built in mesher and the CAE model import option is a Siemens exclusive file type the import that is being used is import CAD model into 3D-CAD. This setting can be found under File->Import->Import CAD Model into 3D-CAD. This import option can be found in the toolbar as well and is the isometric cube with a curved arrow coming out of the middle. Importable files: While STAR-CCM+ claims you can import Solidworks files whenever you try to use a solidworks part file or assembly it gives an error of no imported bodies. To get around this you should use a parasolid file. You can do this by saving the solidworks part or assembly as a parasolid file .x_t or .x_b.

If the Chassis tubes are not merged together or made to be one solid part then you may encounter an error regarding manifold vertices and faces or other errots due to the way in which the chassis tubes are modeled with surfaces.

The model is designed to fit in the aero box, avoid collisions with steering and control arm droop, allow some space for possible anti-roll bar(s), and allow iteration in CFD. This model needs ride height studies along with inlet/outlet studies. Another point of interest is feed and interaction from the front wing. One point of interest on this design is the theory that curvature might help allow a smoother flow but this is unproven. We are also interested in the possibility of adding winglets to the back of the diffuser as well as strakes underneath the car and the effect they would have. We will later consider studying the effects of front wing vortex generators and how they may help maintain undertray downforce. Other important studies might include roll, pitch, and yaw studies as the undertray is sensitive to all 3 of these conditions. Aero Page 35 Concept B This concept has similar design goals to concept A. It includes 3 sections but no curvature for more simplicity. It also includes strakes and a Nolder NX along the trailing edge of the diffuser section. One idea we had was to extend the section between the wheels and the chassis to have a 2™ smaller inlet that feeds from approximately where the front wing is through under the control arms and into the main undertray where its flow combines with the existing intake.

Believe it's two separate symptoms, same fault code. Set inverter settings to files below and no longer fault at all with the inverter, car can run 240nm (with slightly reduced performance) and seems to be performing well. 10_26_23 Log testing BSPD? Car knocks out of TS (green tsal) while driving, even at different speeds and pedal travel. Driver can put 5% pedal pressure and trip it while pressing gas. Cannot adjust pot on VCU anymore because of the comparator issue. Vmax=Vcc-1.5V, so max setting is 3.71V and thus the pedal trips sooner in the travel range. Brake bleed was poor, which means resting the foot on the pedal or slight presses would trigger BSPD. A better bleed would help this by firming up the pedal, effectively pushing the trip point further back. Rotating the pot could be possible as well, but adjustment is still lacking. Brakes are squishy and fluid was boiling off of rotors Rotors are dirty from brake flush- clean them and don't let fluid get everywhere when bleeding brakes, and please don't contaminate the pads Pedal is squishy- get a better bleed All of the above issues affected BSPD because it set the trip point closer to the pedal travel and caused BSPD to trip easily There was brake fluid in the APPS2, BSE, and Brake overtravel Deutsch connectors, enough to have a standing pool of fluid.

The BMS kept kicking in the low voltage protection and that’s why it had the faulting. Car immediately was driven slowly up to the shop and turned off. Cell will need charging to a safe voltage and replacement ASAP. This was pulled right when the car stopped, and the low voltage error is what is causing SOC to be 0%.

The KS5c body was designed to be as close to one piece as possible. It includes the nose, the top of the car, and some of the sides. The design was done with surface modeling around the frame and components of the car. The mold was decided to be made from insulation foam paneling. This mold will end up being very large, and if it was made from MDF, it would weigh around 200lbs. And | don't think you want to be lugging around a 200Ib mold. It could also be done as two negative mold halves to make the surface finish a lot cleaner right off the bat, but that would require more foam and it would also end up being very difficult to layup the carbon inside the mold (unless you have 5 foot long arms??). Step 1: Machined foam BJ machined 7 individual stacks of foam on Architecture's 5-axis Onsrud CNC mill. This was done because the length of the bit is only so long. It will also avoid having to do 4 or 5 axis CAM work, which is an absolute headache Step 2: Glue up Once the chunks come off the machine, they need to be glued up. We used the same",

    "text": "is an absolute headache Step 2: Glue up Once the chunks come off the machine, they need to be glued up. We used the same glue that was used to initially glue up the layers. It is a specialty spray adhesive made for foam. (3M 78 for Insulation and Polystyrene) As always, make sure you weigh down your parts that are gluing up. Step 3: Initial Foam Prep Sometimes the machine will mess up and leave marks or take chunks out of the part. The controller software sometimes gets confused and will just drop the bit into your pretty part. We don't know why, but it happens. Luckily it's foam so the tool isn't damaged and it's fairly easy to fix. We take expanding spray foam and just spray it into the holes left there. Also add some to any large cracks. Once it is dry, rough sand the whole thing to start to get the surface closer to being smooth. 100 grit works well for this. Think of it like sculpting. Main goal is to get it close to the final shape you want. Step 4: Prep Fiberglass/Start Designing Ply Schedule and \"Maps\" This step is where you will start cutting out your fiberglass to coat the mold. The fiberglass is used here to seal the foam and create a hard, non-porous surface. This is also a good time to start planing your ply schedule and what | call, \"maps.\" The \"maps\" are the individual templates for each piece that you'll put on. Since for",

    "text": "start planing your ply schedule and what | call, \"maps.\" The \"maps\" are the individual templates for each piece that you'll put on. Since for a complex shape like this, you can't just cover it in one single piece. Either the shape is too complex and requires a computer software to \"unfold\" the 3d shape into a 2d template, or you just can't fit the whole thing onto one piece of carbon/glass (since rolls are only 40\" or 50\" wide). This also gives you a nice time to experiment and see if your \"maps\" will work. You'll want to be putting at least 2 or 3 layers of fiberglass down. There is a good chance you will be adding more fiberglass later. Composites Page 2 Post your questions below and I'll answer them. This way, everyone will be able to see the questions and answers and it will all be here on this document. ¢ Question (name) O Answer Step 5: Applying Fiberglass This step is fairly easy. All you're doing is coating the foam in fiberglass to create a hard shell. Make sure to fully wet out the fabric and do your best to make sure it is laying fully flat against the foam. Goal should be for 2 to 3 layers over everything. While you will most likely need to apply more layers later, the better job you do now, the less work you'll have to put in for fixing bubbles or problem spots.

    "text": "now, the less work you'll have to put in for fixing bubbles or problem spots. The resin used can be either the regular epoxy resin we use for layups, or fiberglass resin. The fiberglass resin is a bit cheaper however, so go with that. Make sure to mix in smallish batches however to prevent the bowl of resin from gel-ing up in a few minutes. Amine Blush!! When all epoxy resins dry in open air and exposed to moisture, it will form what is called an amine blush. It is a reaction that happens when the curing resin mixes with moisture in the air. Normally, when under vacuum, there is no air or moisture for it to react with. However, when doing this fiberglass shell, or any other repairs involving epoxy resin, an amine layer will form. It will create this sticky, oily, coating that will make it feel like it is permanently wet. This can be reduced by covering the resin with release film/peel-ply. This way the amine layer will hopefully form on the fabric, instead of your part. You can then remove the peel-ply afterwards. The amine layer can create a few problems. First, it will make subsequent layers of resin, paint, adhesive, etc. not bond properly to the surface. Second, it will clog up your sandpaper within seconds if you try to sand the surface. And we will be doing a lot of sanding on this mold. Luckily, it is fairly easy to remove. Soapy water and a Scotch-brit pad will make quick",

The clamp at the petal end gave way and needed spacers, this needs to be addressed. During start up the 7.5 amp fuse for the fuel pump blew. Fuel was added and a new 7.5 added and no further issued presented. This needs to be checked for current and check if no fuse causes an over current.

The timing table was updated for 2000 to 8500 range. This made a notable difference. Before shake down we tightened up steering and connected oil pressure to the driver readable gauge.

This failure was two part. First the moment around the lower motor mount bolt created by the cariear tie in being above the axis of the bolt resulted in a clean shear of the .028 tube and its weld. This failure was due to bad geometry and my sub par weld of a .15 wall to a .028 wall. Part two of the failure was due to the lower bolt being able to pivot allowed the force to be taken by the top mount.

This was removed beofre the next outing. Fuel issue. We lost fuel pressure and went find the issue, first the 15 amp fues was blown, this is off as the pump has a 8%9 amp spike and 6 normal. After replaceing the fuse it did not blow but the pump did not attempt to start. Whe checked voltage at the tanks connector, it was a find 12.4v. We opend up the tank and looked for a break in the plug, none was evadent. In removal of the pump the plug was busted. After this we decided to resodder the pluf in to the crimp and replace using a heat gun sodder joint. The pump was bench tested and worked. We reassembled and ran for 10 min with out issued. After refilling the tank the pump quit. We concluded here. The next day the tank was oppened, the heat gun sodder joint was not adaquit and failled the pull test, it was replace with a crimp on twist nut. The pump failed the bench test, and wires were check for resistance. No issures were found. The new pump was inserted and reassembled and ran without issue.

The hub odometer was installed prior to this test and presented a few issues. This new bracket caused the lugs to loosen up during the course of the day.

The rear left upright continued to worsen in the duration of the day, we did not take it apart to investigate. We had the lower hex bolt on the upper head coolant outlet loosen up and allow a small leak of water that worsened at a point, snugged it back up and the leak was solved. Good up to 200deg We concluded the day after notating an increased thoughted noise and more than normal intake noise. After jiggling the parts of the intake the bottom bond had failed. This likely happened because of a combination of events. The head rest is used to take pressure off the intake, with it unbolted this cannot happen.

We deceided to check everything over and check pad compound. We determined that the purple compound on the left side is superior to the grey on the right side. During shake down laps we ran the car out of gas. We used 1.48 gal of fuel to go 11.3 miles. We determined to have a fuel concumption of 7.7 miles per a galon. We conducted this test with the Hub odometer and by weighing the gas before and after re filling the car to the same spot. The hub odometer bracket yeilded after this. We need to use a materieal that can handle a higher stress. It was removed after this The car ran accell well untill sepration between the carbon runners and the flanges were noted. This allowed more power and a high idle, the intake was braced forward to midigate this. Evans note below. We tightned up the motor mounts twice during these runs, it contenues to be an issue. We also had to pay attentin to an undiscoverd intermitint coolan leak, and the left rear camber adjustment backing out. Evans notes: That's one of the things that needs to be looked at.

And with the whole things siting on a big shaking block, doesn't help things. There are a million and one adhesives out there. First narrow down by ones that can be exposed to gas/oil and still be fine. Then narrow it down to ones that can bond to carbon, and aluminum, since it will be used on both. How strong does it need to be. We currently use E60-HP because that's what Spencer/Graham recommended. But their use case scenarios aren't the same as ours. Again, dummy strong, but for an intake, does it need to be? It works great for bonding inserts into tubes, but so far, doesn't look like it does too well for intakes. Should still be left with about 100 adhesives, pick like 6 or 8 at least. Test them all. Not quite sure how to make the rig, but i would test for fatigue too. Maybe vibrational fatigue if possible? Bond 2 pieces together, have a small mass on one end and a shaker on the other. Eh. Would be a good way to fully validate adhesive beyond just comparing data sheets and simple shear MITS tests. Would bring testing closer to usage case. And this is just one part of what can be changed. Intake design and mold design can also be changed.

We spoke briefly about Swaging some of our bearings. Bearing being used: HIN4T By FK Bearings https://www.fkrodends.com/products/spherical-bearings/high-misalignment- series/hin-t/ Spherical Housing: 4130 Chromoly housing drawing attached. Machined to light press fit. We have run in to issued with hour current hand steaking wallowing and failing at 400 miles. Our setup only applies vertical load on the bearing towards the lipped direction. However we do see the normal force of our ~8lb assembly and this component does oscillate under harsh driving conditions. We are looking in to alternate ways to get a stronger hold in the vertical direction and a more repeatable process. 4/5/2022 Wednesday, April 6, 2022 1:01 PM Prior: Mesured complyance in toe connections Torqued top hat bolts to 12 FT/LBS turques Pic of front right tire Took car out around 10pm Goal of seat time. e Did simple \"barrel racing\" just to practice clutch control, feel of brakes, and setting car into hairpen turn e Car cranked, ran great e Noticed car pushed more turning left than right noticeably. o Measured camber on front after outing oO Front Right +.5 oO Front Left -1 e This was also apparent on tires from picture",

This is likely due to the air being sucked in from the muffler. The muffler has a larger gap in it and that seems to be the reason that the car is backfireing, due to the added oxygen in the muffler. When the car gets up to temp, the car starts combusting unspent fuel in the muffler. | think this is due to the added oxygen in the muffler. Because of this combustion The headers got cherry red, after the car had been running for about 10 minutes. Also because of the combustion, the bolts of the muffler were blowing out.

If it does work even a little bit, | strongly suggesting full welding the one cap to the car. There is a slight concern of detonation, so if welding the muffler does not fix the issue, we need to set up a set of knock ears.

Ohms Test You will need a multimeter set to Ohms for this test. Test every lead of the stator’s connector and note the readings. The reading of each combination should be the same (test leads 1-2, 2-3, and 3-1). If they are different, your stator is defective. Ground",

Put the negative lead on the engine’s ground and the positive lead on each wires of the stator’s connector one by one. You shouldn’t get a reading at all. If you get a reading, even very small, on any wire, the stator is defective and must be changed. AC Output Test Put your multimeter to AC Volts and start you vehicle. As with the Ohms test, test between each lead of the connector (1-2, 2-3, 3-1) and note the readings. They should all be the same (E.g. 20v/20v/20v). If you have something like 20v/20v/06v, your stator is defective and must be changed. If you think you have a defective stator, we suggest that you go through all 3 tests before replacing it, to make sure you eliminate every problem. From <http://statorproblems.com/15_how-to-test-a-stator.html> Should also do a current test of the whole car to make sure we did not start drawing excess current Last week we did have to replace a coil pack with the wrong size and have not checked the draw on the coils and this may be a cause.

Our Main shop is located in the Engineering Technology Building, on the first floor, room Q134. We have 12 sub-teams broken up into: Business/media, Aerodynamics, Composites, Frame, Vehicle Dynamics, Suspension, Driver Interfaces, Low Voltage/Wiring, Data Acquisition/Firmware, EV Powertrain, Driveline, Machining, To learn more about what each subgroup is responsible for and what we do, attend our weekly meeting on Monday @8pm in the main shop How dol join? We have a rules test to become a Member that covers some basic information regarding the technical rules surrounding our racing series. If you are only interested in",

If you are only interested in business, Graphic design, or marketing, don’t worry, you'll take a non-technical rules test! What does the test go over? The technical rules test for Engineers covers sections IC, V, IN, T, F.1, F.5, D, EV.1, EV.4, and EV.5 in the rules handbook, which is located on FSAE Online under Series Resources. The test is 40 questions of mixed short answer and multiple choice. There is no need to worry about trick questions. All the questions are straightforward and are taken directly from the handbook. https://www.fsaeonline.com/cdsweb/gen/DocumentResources.aspx When and where can | take the test? The test is in person in Q134 and you may take the test whenever you have time to take it. If you have any free time between or after classes just ask in the #new-member chat if anyone is in the shop, or stop by to see if people are there. Chances are, there will be someone there to let you take the test and go over it with you afterwards! What happens if | fail the test? lf you fail the test don't panic as not everyone passes it on other first try, just study a little more and retake it. You have unlimited tries with 24 hours in between attempts, just study and retake it whenever you get the chance. Do | need any experience to join the team?

Although having experience in related fields can help you understand things more easily, you don't actually need any experience to join. Everything you need to succeed in the team you can learn here, just make sure to ask questions as that is the best way to learn. PM Page 19 What can | do to get involved? Once you pass the test just ask around, there are always projects for people with any skill level to work on. If you already know what subgroup you want to join then talking to the leads will get you started very quickly. How much time do | have to put into the team? You can put in as much or as little time as you want, but consistency is key. Consistently showing up for a few hours every week can help you learn a lot. If any of these do not answer your questions feel free to ask, there is always someone that wants to help.

First identify the material you are welding as each material has different procedures 2. Let's start with steel, a. We weld mostly 4130 chromoly tube; chromoly has mill scale from the facturing process that needs to be removed from the top layer of welding, failure to do so will result in contamination in the weld and will make for a weaker weld b. To remove the mill scale you must use an abrasive such as the wire wheel, or scotch-brite pads. c. The metal should no longer be gray and have a nice shiny finish to it d. Your metal is now ready to weld 3. Now let's move on to aluminum a. Aluminum requires a more intensive cleaning process than steel since it is more prone to contamination within the weld. i. Most of are aluminum part are cut on the water jet and will contain garnet in the edge of the weld. Garnet will contaminate your aluminum welds and make for a more difficult weld and a weaker joint. To remove the garnet you must file down the edge of the part until shiny Now that the garnet is removed you must now clean the part with a scotch-brite pad to remove",

Once done you should wipe down the surface with acetone to remove any remaining contaminant's e. Not only will you need to wipe down the part but also the filler rod you will be using. f. Your aluminum is now ready for welding 4. In general these are the practices you should follow for the majority of the parts we weld here. While on occasion we weld different grades of steel the general procedure remains the same. While we weld more metals than just aluminum and steel the other metals will be discussed further on in the guide Torch Setup: Torches come in a wide range of sizes, shapes, and use different \"Consumables\" Consumable- Items that wear over time and you will constantly be changing/ adjusting and changing out EX...

The other one is known as a stubby gas lens. As a personal preference we have switched over to gas lenses due to a more compa ct size, This is a personal preference and some argue that Standard bodies work better. Find the one you prefer, with welding it is important to remember that there are many ways to weld so find the way in which you are comfortable. For us that means Stubby Gas Lenses. Last but definitely not least Welding Cups Welding Cups come in various shapes and sizes as well as material, above you can see a few cups that we most likely have arou nd the shop. The pink is a standard alumina cup, these are great for ac and dc welding and are usually the cheapest available cu ps, the white is a furick cup, furick cups are expensive but offer a much slimmer package they also use smaller gas lenses.

This is just step 1 of cups step 2 goes into which sizes are used for what materials, A size 4-8 is recommended for aluminum to decrease white oxidation line on material A size 8-12 is recommended for Steel and this is what is mainly used on chassis welding and tabs A size 16-18 is used for Titanium and sometimes stainless steel Keep these cups to exotic materials as they use more argon. As a rule of thumb your gas flow should be 2.5x the size of your cup size so a size 8 cup uses 20 CFM Stick-out is also based off the size of your cup, the rule of thumb here your stick-out Is cup size/ 16 in inches for a size 8 cup you should have 8/16ths or 1/2 in of stick-out. This is a rule of thumb but generally stick-out can allow you to have better visibility in most areas. In dire situations a size 18 cup will give you the most stick-out and might be necessary And know you know how to set up your torch Machine Setting There are a couple of settings that you will be changing regularly when welding such as amperage, polarity, postflow/preflow . While our machines allow to change more settings there is no real need to change them. Amperage: Amperage is the amount of \"heat\" you are putting into a part the higher the amperage the more heat you will put into a part. The general",

    "text": "the amount of \"heat\" you are putting into a part the higher the amperage the more heat you will put into a part. The general rule of thumb is to use 1 amp per thousand of an inch of material thickness. For example if you are welding a part witha thickness of .045 you should use around 45 amps. Now this rule does not have to be followed but it will give you a good start ing point of where to set amperage. As we move into more advanced joints the material thickness will vary so you will need to be able to Machining Page 27 control the foot pedal well. Soeaking of foot pedals, the foot pedal connected to the machine allows us to vary our amperage and will have a maximum amperage to what you set on the machine. As you get better at controlling the foot pedal the need to cha nge amperage on the machine will decrease as you will be able to weld most materials with the same amperage setting on the machine. Polarity: Our machines have two settings for polarity, AC and DC. DC is used to weld steel, stainless steel, titanium and various other metals. AC on the other hand is used to weld aluminum and various other metals we don’t weld here. In general Dc does not have many settings you can change, on the other hand AC does; With AC you can change the frequency, balance and waveshape, well get more in depth with what each of",

Postflow/preflow: Post flow is the amount argon you will have after you finish welding. This is critical as having argon flow when done welding will prevent oxidation of the weld and will therefore make a stronger weld. Not only does this prevent oxidation of the metal but oxidation of the tungsten. Preflow is the same thing as post flow but come before an arc is struck. Pre flow will help make s ure that there are no contaminants in the air surrounding the material. Some metals don’t require as much post flow as other aluminum for example does not need much post flow on the material itself but is need to cool down the tungsten, metals like titanium require larger amounts of post flow as oxide will for if the metal is not covered properly Argon/Cups Filler Material Machining Page 28 Welding plan Friday, July 14, 2023 1:12 AM Get person welding. Look for consistency in welds and them move down in thicknesses to gain more control. A consistent weld should be: Good pattern not too big of a heat affected zone.

Good technique with filler rod should include keeping the filler rod at a proper distance from the weld puddle and not adding an excessive amount of filler to the weld as this will lead to too tall of a weld. The weld should remain mostly flat throughout. The key step when training someone is to make sure they know why they are doing what they are doing and what changes that they are making are having an effect on their welds. If they are being inconsistent its good to ask what changes they made, were making the welds look better or worse. Sheet of a thickness that not too thick but not too thin should be used when first training a welder. .070 works well for starting some one off As the trainee becomes for comfortable with welding consider moving to tube welding. To start off have them weld tube ends together as this is more difficult to do and will help move around tube. Machining Page 29",

The open space on the rear of the cart (with the open wheel well) has historically been used to store driver gear bags. The open space on the front of the cart, however, has been completely useless. Can either put a small barrier to stop items there from falling, or make it a waterproof container for sensitive items. And while we're here, check if we need to replace wheels. Assigned: David Gastou 9/11/25 Wasim tasked David Gastou with upgrading the pit cart, this included adding walls to the bottom part of the pit cart to keep things from hitting the wheels and the upper deck of the bottom part so that to be able to store small equipment/tools. David took measurements and cadded the “upper deck’ of the bottom of the pit cart. Wasim also told David to ask subgroups for changes they would like to see in the pit cart. TJ suggested to improvise the support for the DAQ antenna and to add a spot to charge the EV batteries David suggested to make the “upper deck” a type of charging station for the batteries, Wasim thought this was fine but to focus on the antenna support After some research and a home depot trip David came to the conclusion to use a 1 72” pvc pipe would sway the least while not being exaggerated, and a",

Wasim approved of this idea.

Safety Mass Distribution of KS8E Crasis 68 Low Voltage Driveine «25, S26 Low ‘Misc KS9 Arch_ Page 23 Vehicle Mass Tracking Sheet Saturday, August 23, 2025 4:49 PM The KS8E had many design changes made to it throughout the fall semester and none of it was ever consolidated or documented against each subgroup. Because of that the mass creeped up between the car before and after the design season going way out of our projection. Although no apparent components failed throughout this mass creep, fundamentally there will be a point where if an unaccounted for mass increase of the car happens, component design will have to propagate and everything on the car will have to be increased as a result To combat this fundamental issue of the car and an attempt to control the mass to make wiser and more justified design decisions, mass tracking will be implemented incrementally throughout the design season so mass of the car does not run away with the development of the car KM Mass Track.xlsx From <https://kennesawedu.sharepoint.com/sites/Team-test ksu/ layouts/15/sharedialog.aspx?listld=30633b31-2f3f-4c37- afia-fee052f7f83c&clientlId=sharePoint&sessionld=dbbObea1-f09b-a000-039c-6e980e9fc29c&listltemld=2063 &clickTime= 1755986299999&sharingCorrelationld=59ea6e4a-034a-407f-9ea0-2890904clac6&mode=copy&ma=1 &fullScreenMode=true&itemName=KM Mass Track.xlsx&channelld=ae8ca821-5593-4393-a915-54061b41f351&origin=https% 3A%2F%2Fkennesawedu.sharepoint.com> KS9 Arch_ Page 24 Vehicle Architecture Synth Saturday, August 23, 2025 5:37 PM One night before Michelin testing, topic came up about how we were deriving lower level vehicle targets and how they were supposed to support the goals set for the overall vehicle and it's placement in competition so they don't contradict/ conflict with other vehicle goals.

The main reason is there are nearly an infinite amount of solutions for possible vehicle designs at the upper levels of the flow chart This is where defining both resource and vehicle constraints are going to be a very important thing to implement and see where that limits or improves other possible cascading design decisions. This is logic that also holds true in real world engineering application, sometimes designs overall have to cope with rigid design architectural constraints.

Sunday, June 29, 2025 7:10 PM This page is under construction btw lol, some descriptions are a little long Also this is “heavily inspired\" by Val's welcome page from last year Welcome totheLow Voltage subgroup! What we make on the car: Wire harnesses + connectors Low voltage wire harnesses distribute power and communications to various devices and sensors across the car. Our low voltage system is powered by 12 volts DC, and our devices communicate through the CAN protocol. To make our harness modular, we commonly use two main types of \"Deutsch\" connectors, Deutsch (DT) and Deutsch Mini (DTM). Control circuit design Develop the logic behind circuits that control vehicle function. One good example would be our Vehicle Control Unit, which requires the Brake System Plausibility Device (BSPD) per FSAE rules. The BSPD is a critical device that monitors brake position and throttle position. If it detects the driver is pressing both petals simultaneously past a certain threshold, it shuts down the motor. This is in case of a stuck throttle. Per rules, this cannot be done using code, so clever use of electrical logic gates are used in our VCU. PCB design and soldering To bring our circuit design into a robust, compact form, we design custom PCBs using Altium Designer (will go over how to access Altium student license during an LV class). Our boards are exported from Altium and purchased from a manufacture called JLCPCB. Components on the board are purchased from a reputable electronic component store such as",

To reduce costs, all of our boards are assembled and soldered by hand. Work with Data Acquisition (to make their wishes come true) Data acquisition requires readings from multiple sensors across the car in real time. While DAQ deals with how to obtain and interpret the data using firmware, our low voltage subgroup deals with how to integrate these necessary sensors into our wiring. “Per Formula SAE rules, any electrical system within the car that operates with less than 60 volts is considered low voltage. However, many of the low voltage systems we design interact with high voltage (above 60v)\" Things we've built in the past: Shut Down Circuit (SDC) Our vehicle has seven \"E-Stop\" switches as well as two code-controlled relays in the ACU that are all wired in series. This is so if one of these switches is latched (and therefore disconnects), the entire \"shut down circuit loop\" is disconnected. Our shut down circuit is defined with a purple wire. This creates a very robust shut down system. Tractive Control Unit (TCU) Controls the isolation relays, which connect and disconnect the high voltage battery from the rest of the car. Power to the TCU is provided by the shut down circuit loop, so if any of the aforementioned E-stop switches is latched, power to the TCU will be lost, and therefore the isolation relays will be",

Accumulator Control Unit (ACU) Monitors battery cell temperatures from our Module Distribution Boards (MDB) and any faults from our Isolation Monitoring Device (IMD). If a cell reaches too high of a temperature, or the IMD detects insufficient isolation between high voltage and the chassis, the ACU will disconnect our shutdown circuit (SDC), shutting off the TCU. Low Voltage Page 1 Dashboard Corner Board A small board that interprets sensor data across the car and sends that data over CAN communication lines. Sensors it is designed to monitor include wheel speeds, suspension displacement, load cells, brake pad temperature, brake line pressure, and the ability to upgrade in the future.

Running theory is that there was a short from the MAX7480ESA to the output of the LM2904. Due to propagation delay and a much smaller parasitic capacitance on the output of the LM2904 vs its VCC pin, it likely experienced a brief backfeed of current into its output pin, causing a runaway event as the op-amp attempts to correct its output. \"The pedal potentiometers were questionable and were replaced shortly after \" This theory relies",

The pedal potentiometers are 5k ohms with a wiper connected to signal output. At resting position, say about 5%, there is 5% of 5k ohms in between signal output and GND. 5000 ohm * 0.05 = 250 ohms Pedal pot is rated for 0.15 watts of dissipation across its entire wiper (most likely) 0.15w * 0.05 = 0.0075w of actual dissipation between 0-5% wiper If a short were to be made between 5% and GND, it would produce: 12v/250ohms = 0.048 amps 12v * 0.048a = 0.576 watts Over half a watt over the max rating. Very likely instantly burned the pot in that range, or maybe increased PTC resistance until no further damage.

So long as the aero package does not exceed this target, the car will have enough energy to complete endurance without needing to conserve energy through throttle discipline.

Tire tractive force can be broken down to the following basic friction equation: Ly That is, the lateral force is equal to the product of the tires friction coefficient and the normal force acting on the tire. It is clear that by increasing the normal force on the tire you will linearly increase lateral acceleration potential, which is related to velocity by: F,R Therefore, using substitution, velocity is proportional to the square root of normal force acting on the tire. In reality, the system is more complex than this relationship, including effects of tire slip angle, balance of pressure, however this summarizes the general trends.

    "text": "this relationship, including effects of tire slip angle, balance of pressure, however this summarizes the general trends. How'scz2] What's good design? “Good” design of an aero package, however, is not solely reliant on how much downforce it can produce. With the addition of downforce comes the addition of drag, which has a net negative effect on the car's performance. There are two primary detractors from added drag: lap time and energy consumption. Drag acts directly against accelerating force, so a vehicle with a large aero package (and lots of drag) will accelerate slower than a vehicle without (this is what defined early race car design philosophy). The nuance here comes from incorporating downforce. Faster cornering speeds means corner exit speed is higher than a non-aero car, and the aero car generally covers the straight distance quicker than a non-aero car, that is if the downforce benefits outweigh the drag. We'll come back to this point. Since drag is a force that is applied over time, it can be defined as work the car is producing and therefore requires energy to sustain. Over an endurance in 2023 FSAE Electric, drag force was calculated to account for about 1/3 of energy consumed. This has a huge impact on efficiency points, and is more impactful on points than the time loss from isolated drag effects. Coming back to that point about drag outweighing downforce, it is important to identify how much drag you are willing to accept for the amount of downforce you are generating, or the other way",

This was done to avoid complexity of adding in the other component iterations at each step and quicken the iterative process. To re-iterate, we were looking at large changes and avoiding small interactions. The most important conceptual decisions that will begin the feasibility & fine tuning phase are as follows: Starting from the front of the car moving rearwards, the front wing will focus on a shorter \"split\" mainplane that has a better pressure to surface area ratio. It will avoid implementing complex geometry for tire wash/UT flow control due to the added complexity outweighing the observed effects, and will instead rely on whole wing camber tuning and \"whisker\" elements to condition downstream air to the UT and RW. The UT will focus on a mid-car placement between the wheels with airfoil shaped, stacked element side tunnels. A flat bottom will bridge the two side tunnels that provides clean air to the bottom of the car. The RW will focus on a 3 element profile that has a lofted feature in the middle. The 3 elements allow for easier DRS implementation as it reduces the movable flaps to 2 instead of 3. The central loft increases the camber and reduces angle of incidence with the air, allowing the RW to access free stream flow coming from above the drivers head. Louvers and other drag",

Louvers and other drag reduction methods will be investigated during the fine tuning stage. This process has clarified which concepts are most effective that fit within the targets set by the SRR. The next phase uses the best concept of each component and combines them to focus on intricate fine tuning with hard constraints from manufacturability, assembly, mounting, and whole car integration (radiator, jacking bar, chassis changes, etc.) Executive Summary The goal of FW development is to improve from KS8. The KS8 front wing suffered from flow separation on upper elements, low camber airfoils, ineffective EP vortex generators, and integration issues regarding jacking point access. 2D airfoil simulations identified that higher camber increased downforce over flat airfoils at the most optimal ground height for ground effect (about 2 inches ata chord of 18 in, or 1/9 the length of the chord), showing this as a dominant trait. It was also discovered that single elements (mainplanes) would separate flow on the bottom side towards the trailing edge unless a stacked element was placed behind. Furthermore, the mainplane could be \"split\" into two airfoils to increase the surface area in which there was low pressure and reduce the area that was ambient, making it more efficient at producing downforce for its surface area and therefore weight. Overall, the FW during this phase improved downforce by about 20% relative to itself (not whole car) while also reducing in",

So we will just work on mounting and not worry about internal structure Outcome: we have not ruled out Nathan's internal wing structure, we just need to find how the FW mount will connect to the chassis by the SES deadline.

Post-meeting Tasks: Seth Aero targets in place Specific requirements for each component set Downforce Ground Clearance Sim requirements for later design (Sweeps) Quang Cooper Quick thought dump: Rear Wing Development - This will be the gating component for FW and UT, so make as much downforce as possible within the component level drag budget - Start with making a bunch of downforce, then tune out the drag as much as you can and see where that lands. Make 2-3 concepts that achieve this. © Once we put full car together, we will be able to tune out more drag with flow control devices up-stream. - Check your \"RW\" OneNote tab for details on constraints - Review relevant Aero rules including RTD light visibility.

The Unitek Bamocar (We have the 400T1 in the shop) the cascadia models (PM and CM series) and then like twoish years ago the DTI ones showed up. So it was between these options and the making our own (we never planned on doing this). We had reliability issues with the bamocar with our 300V car where it blew the Switches above 39 kW. So that left the cascadia options CM200dz (only 600V option without crazy oversize) or the DTI 550 or 850. We ran with the cm200 as we got the used model way cheaper that the normal price (3500 instead of 7100) which was also cheaper than both DTI models (I think 5500 and 6500).

Exceeding the inlet and internal geometry of the radiator would likely have negative effects on heat transfer. - 3/8\" may force the pump into low-flow operation (higher electrical draw per unit heat removed).

IMPORTANT NOTE: For centrifugal pumps like the one currently on the car (EWP 150) this pressure isn't actually reality because they do not force a fixed flow Wednesday, August 13, 2025 11:36 PM Conclusions: Ultimately, testing was pretty inconclusive. We could not isolate a specific part or reason as to why: a. Why the pump was dying. b. Why the flow in the system is so low. (The flow is low because the pump is dying lol) It is probably a combination of issues. Morgan pointed out that output from the pump to the AN line is a large decrease in diameter, could be caused backup/clog and causing the impeller to stall. Output from water pump is also immediately put into a 90 degree bend. We can hear the pump occasionally make a loud noise. Stalling? Cavitating? | am unsure. No tests were done to determine the effects of the AN lines on flow reduction. Input to the pump is also a small AN fitting, perhaps we are losing pressure trying to pull water in thru such a small entrance. More generally, it feels the pump is just over-specced for what we need it for. It is trying to flow at a much higher rate than the system can really handle.

Adding a power controller allows us to independly control the pump pressure We are not meeting the min reqs for flow for the inverter. (3 GPM) We are barely meeting the min reqs for the motor. (2 GPM) Possibly introducing air into system at fittings? Rad overflow fitting is sitting on barely a thread. How do you know this? Is it just vibes based? Unsure if the color of the water after exiting the loop is an issue. Unsure what is causing it. Yes this is an issue, as per the rules water must be pure, overly contaminated water is an issue. T.5.4.2 Other: Should test head pressure requirements of both inverters (PM100DX and CM200DZ) We should measure temperature across multiple points across the system so we can characterize the whole loop/energy requirements. Need an actual pressure relief cap on rad, probably loosing pressure at overflow cap. Done by Varun Devidas, Morgan Hart, and Camden Burns. Pump failed at Michelin testing, troubleshooting why. The process of testing follows the correct flow path (pump outlet-> motor->inverter->rad high side->pump inlet) Ran bucket test on the whole system, then isolated specific parts.

From my research if we are going to have one we should get some thermistors and place one before the motor and one after the inverter to track the high of the coolant and what the temperature of the coolant is when entering the motor. If we can have 3 one after motor and inverter would be nice and then still one after the pump behind motor.

    "text": "So it’s a first law of thermo question. Consider all of the energy into the system must equal all of the energy out of the system, in a seady-state. So: Eout = Ein Qradiator = Wpump + Qinverter + Qmotor Pump work can probably be neglected here so: Qradiator = Qinverter + Qmotor And: The radiator heat rejection is evaluated as some coefficient, U, times surface area, A, times the mean temperature difference, MTD. Some manufacturers may use log mean temperature difference, LMTD instead of MTD. Just google LMTD if you need it. Let me know if you have questions. Most will probably use MTD. Therefore: U*A*MTD = Qinverter + Qmotor So: If you know what design temp you want the fluid to be in Line D and Line C, then you can calculate LMTD (or MTD), if you assume the airside temperatures (see below point 2 to evaluate air side temperatures). Then, you can lookup (or ask manufacturer) for heat transfer coefficient values, U. From there, you can determine surface area of radiator, A. A= (Qinverter + Qmotor)/(MTD*U) Now, you mentioned you wanted to consider different pump rates and line pressures. Below is analysis for each of these: . Pump flow rate will impact LMTD in the above analysis. (Anyone who has taken thermo can help you with this) Qradiator = Qinverter + Qmotor = Mdot_water*Cp_water*(Td— Tc) where Mdot_water is mass flow of water, Cp_water is specific heat of water and Td is temperature of Line D and Tc is temperature of Line Cc.

    "text": "mass flow of water, Cp_water is specific heat of water and Td is temperature of Line D and Tc is temperature of Line Cc. Therefore, you can write an equation for Td as a function of Tc and Mdot. You can substitute this equation into the formula for MTD and then solve radiator size for different flow rates and Heat Sources, etc. . This same analysis for pump flow applies for the air side. Qradiator = Qinverter + Qmotor = Mdot_air*Cp_air*(Tout— Tin) where Mdot_air is mass flow of air, Cp_air is specific heat of air and Tout is temperature of air leavingradiator, and Tin is temperature of air entering radiator (presumed to be ambient). Now you can consider analysis for different air flow rates through radiator. . Line pressure will have virtually no impact on this analysis, assuming you are dealing with an approximately incompressible fluid like water, and assuming you do not boil the water. The only impact will be that the pressure in the line must be higher than the saturation pressure of whatever water temperature you have so it will not boil. Anyone that has taken thermo can help you with this or ask me some questions on this. Hope this helps. Let me know if you need more info.

The 3 general proposals are having no switch and run it full time (there's still a lot of room for discussion on how this would be turned on) (this one seems to make the most sense to me as the current accumulator needs and states it needs constant flow unlike the one we had before that was able to manage its own heat for a period of time), have something setup with what boards are currently set up to the car where it reads temperature and then cuts the pump on when it reaches a specific temp, or having something turn on and off based on location on the lap and we model it based on testing.

The current battery (12v 12ah if | remember correctly) can run the pump for about 2 hours constantly so tj proposed maybe getting a bigger battery for testing and/or more of the same battery to swap them in and out when they die. Chance did say some issues will arise when switching them in and out where they might not log the data or something along those lines? Talked to Gtms and they run a series through 2 radiators with the hose behind the driver with an additional firewall. Also their radiators are tilted forward which | found interesting, and the ducting at least according to them really helped with the line of sight rule. The radiators are like custom and like 700 bucks a piece with discount, but they are still really small and seemed to work well enough for them, although a different system. They also showed me their amp draw for their fans and it was about 5 amps with a 6 amp peak and they have it set for whenever it gets past a temp it turns on. They also said they have a matlab script for a lot of their characterization stuff. Also they gave me some tips on if we do run parallel, the pressure valves are an absolute must because if the flows are not literally identical it's worse than a parallel, parallel is a small margin better than series for cooling and balancing with the cars weight as long as",

    "text": "down amperage to the pump and therefore control flow rate of water. We did two runs, one at 5amps and the other at 2.5 amps. Flow rate went from about 2.2GPM @5amps to 0.9GPM @2.5amps, yet inverter peak temp on rose by ~2degs Celsius, from 34.7 to 36, nowhere near the over-temp limit. We then upped car speed, doing a full pull hitting nearly 90mph for a minute, still at 2.5 amps. MFR was about 0.9, but inverter peak temp was 66C. Because the loop is rejecting heat at such a low flow rate, the EBP40 may be sufficient for this loop. The loop, based on the testing, does not really need such a high flow rate like the inverter spec sheet requests. At this lower flow rate, the head requirements also decrease. Determining a system curve would be nice, especially so we don’t have to be guessing whether the EBP40 will work, especially since we know that the system can cool at such a low MFR. It is possible that we simply did not run long enough for inverter to get hot enough for us to know if the flow rate was fine.

Yes it's needed, but an ergo member should design this and not hand it off for a composites member to do cause \"that's their thing’. O Instead, think of going into a design group and doing a design, then manufacturing it in composites later. For example: Aero Structures. You design the internal structure, doing hand analysis, maybe FEA, and lost of good CAD work. Then you take that and manufacture your design which just happens to be a composite material e The point is, | think that every composite member shouldn't look at the car and say what can | make that’s a composite part, but instead looks at bigger design projects that",

But in the fact additive manufacturing acts as wood(in a sense) with a good sandpaper and cleaning can over double the surface energy So by doubling the thickness and roughing up the edges that are connected to the wing we can gain massive benefits and not add any weight if we lightweight the PETG properly (Bond strength=Surface area/failure load) But if you remembered from the beginning of this section, what we bond to on the other side matters to which is resin, the part that will fail in this entire system first will be the Hysol- resin bond because of the material properties of resin (which we cannot really change) This means the optimal way to reduce weight and not compromise on strength is get rid of the hysol and incorporate the PETG into the resin layup (Incorporate structure into the layup) Which now leads us into an another section The layup process makes a good 2 piece airfoil, 2 pieces of an airfoil makes a bad leading edge and trailing edge which also double goofs aero ( very sad)",

Some of the original documentation (from my freshman year) is not great but it can be found in Teams under chassis > files > mono. Some of the original data files for the testing can be found in Teams under Data Acquisition Rule 1 for designing a monocoque: Don't be arrogant or in over your head. Being humble is the best way to avoid failure. Coupon Testing/Jigs When we first embarked on the project in 2020, the first thing we did was make A. the perimeter shear testing jig and B. the 3 point bend testing jig (we already had one so now we have two). | conceptualized but never built a seat-belt pullout testing jig. The design was to be adjustable as to change the angle that the bolt was pulled out as the geometry of this was uncertain. However, seatbelt pullout testing is not necessarily required as per rules if you connect the main hoop and front hoop with tubes on either side and weld the seatbelt mounting tabs to those. | might suggest purchasing a jig from another team is one is available.",

The original perimeter shear testing seemed promising but we only tested 1 side (not a sandwich panel). After this, | made two 3-point bend samples and tested them. They were both comprised of .5\" honeycomb, and varying skin thicknesses, layed up in one shot with adhesive sheet. All these original samples were pre-preg fabric. | am unsure on the exact fiber but | believe T300 3K PW or similar. In testing, one of these samples had a thinner delaminated and the other had a thicker skin and crushed the core. The thicker skinned- sample barely did not pass the required strength in the SES so the solution was to go to 1\" honeycomb with the thicker skin. | am very confident that this one would pass. This sample was made but never tested due to constraints on being able to use the MITTS lab. Design Considerations We originally set out to make a half-monocoque chassis for the IC car. The goal being that it would be cheap and simple to become a reality. The plan was to use expired fabric we had. We originally had no certainty on autoclave/oven time so one idea we had was to lay it up, freeze it under vacuum in the walk-in freezer we had acquired for $100, then wait for autoclave/oven time. The idea was to do a uniform layup meaning one continuous ply schedule",

The idea was to do a uniform layup meaning one continuous ply schedule that would pass the strict rule for side-impact everywhere on the car. Based on my predictions, this conservative design would be within 4 lbs of one of our full-tube frames. (~ 60 Ibs +-4). This value was based off of the actual weight of a side impact 3-point bend sample that | thought would pass and the surface area of a working design. This design would likely be considerably stiffer than a tube frame though we never planned to do any simulation since we would be well-overbuilding it. One thing to note is that other teams have Composites Page 57 published estimated for the point of torsional stiffness diminishing returns to be 2000 Nm/Deg (which a tube frame can achieve) but this does not account for local stiffness requirements. One of the main goals that this would achieve would be freedom of mounting items to anywhere on the car. Pros Mounting freedom Allows iteration from year to year Can drill a hole anywhere to mount Side wing mounting interface is easier Reusability Mold Reusability In a half-monocoque design, the monocoque could be carried over while the rear tube- frame is reused Weight loss after years of development Stiffness Safety Do not have to manufacture a body, side-body, or floor Should create less turbulence and drag having more of the car sealed off by a continuous smooth structure Accu installation on hub",

It would be easier to design and build for the first iteration. (We would have also had enough expired carbon for this). In 2024, the IC is phasing out and the EV is phasing in. My opinion is that an EV would perhaps be easier to design for a monocoque since an accumulator would provide simpler geometry and more freedom for mounting than a combustion motor. This makes the idea of a full monocoque less daunting in my opinion. One thing | like about some of the full monocoques | have seen from other teams is how the teams with hub motors are able to dismount the accumulator out the back of the car as if it is rack-mounted on drawer slides. But this does not make sense for an inboard motor car. Regardless, the team should not bite off more than it can chew. The",

Composites Page 58 Autoclave/Oven In my opinion, an autoclave is not necessary and an oven will do just fine, given a good vacuum. One nuance to this might be if there is problems with adhesion to core material. Another difference between autoclave and oven might be the electrical resistance which would be required to be less than 5 Ohms to GLV for an EV as per the rules. Some possible ovens are: Delta Flight Products Nor Ral GTRI-ATAS Some possible autoclaves are: Delta Tech Ops Nor Ral Atomic 6 (promising) 1 Piece vs Multi-Piece Many teams make the monocoque in one piece while others make it in multi-parts and bond it together. The ones where the monocoque is one piece will require multiple molds that mate together with a very small seam before being layed up on. This will usually create a ‘flash line’ where resin will fill. This can usually be easily knocked off. For a half-coque, this will usually mean 2 molds and for a full monocoque, it may be 3-5 molds (sometimes still 2). Another question that arises from this is “Where do | put the split?”. My original answer was left and right because that is what | was recommended by my superior. My educated opinion is to split the monocoque top and bottom. This would allow",

This would allow the CNC router to make the bottom mold/part in one shot and maintain higher symmetry for the suspension. The top half of the monocoque would be less critical but still has to mate well with the bottom. Fora pre-preg process, | would make the monocoque in one piece if the geometry is possible. This way you do not have to rely on a bond. However, for a resin infused process, 2 parts would be required to be bonded together. Resin Infused vs Pre-Preg vs Cut-and-Fold With wet-layup not being possible, these are the three options. We initially set out to do pre- preg because that was the fabric we had, but that isnt necessarily the gospel. These are the existing processes because they are not very time constrained manufacturing wise like a 2- hour wet-layup is. Resin infusion was not considered since the team did not have experience in it however, resin infusion may be cheaper than pre-preg because pre-preg would require high-temp mold materials. The cut-and-fold process is the idea of using a pre-fabricated sandwich panel, routing contours in the flat sheet, folding it to the desired shape, and bonding it together. This could be reinforced with carbon fiber angle brackets bonded to the chassis. The limitations of this are many however: pre-fabricated flat panels of the required size are not something we could make in house, it would be",

Apart from this, | would say it is a tossup between infused and pre-preg. The team would have to do a cost analysis and have completed successful resin infusions first. Mold Materials (Pre-Preg) The pre-preg process will require a male ‘plug’ and then a female composite mold to be created off of that. This could be either fiberglass or carbon fiber but carbon is recommended because it will have a similar CTE to the final carbon part. These will require Composites Page 59 expensive high-temp resins. Conversely, you could technically get away with committing to a multi-piece-bonded-together monocoque and use high-temp tooling block, but that is also crazy expensive. Another take is to do an aluminum sheet metal mold. This will require minimal surface prep (really nice) but will heavily constrain the design based on how sheet metal can be bent. You may be able to weld multiple pieces together. You will save time on the mold and might save money. It however be hard to hit the correct bending tolerances.

Core Materials We went with Aramid-Nomex honeycomb because it was cheap and we also had it, | see no need to change this. The primary goal is to get thickness to the part without adding weight. If a higher adhesion between core and skin is required, a better adhesive sheet, or higher cell density may be useful. Foam cores will likely be expensive but will be stiffer and have a better bond. If resin infusion is the chosen route, a foam compatible with it will be required. Shape A more square XY profile (Cut section parallel with front plane) may be easier to layup however, a more round (octagonal, filleted, or circular) profile will be torsionally and locally stiffer. In general, keep the geometry simple to save manufacturing headache. Also, flatter regions are easier to mate to. Consider constraints such as cockpit and foot templates, Percy, driver fit, steering wheel placement, steering rack, ergo, seat, firewall, hatches, Al plate, pedal box, suspension mounting, ARBs, aerodynamics and aerodynamic interfaces (ex: side wings, FW), roll bars, headrest bar, MHB, or almost any part of the car.

On non-torqued parts, it may be recommended to fill the surrounding honeycomb with epoxy or use a hard insert in case the bolt moves and damages the surrounding core. Core Crushing This is an issue | have read up on that teams experience where the edge of the honeycomb (rather than the face) is exposed to the wrath of the vacuum and the core crushes from the side. You should generally not be concerned about an autoclave crushing the face of the honeycomb. Cost Yet to input the breakdown in a clean way but expect $6-8k for a first iteration.

Deflects and stresses a lot more with sideways force. Failure criteria is much closer to 1, max being .8. With Standing and kicking load case, the mount sees an absurd amount of force and pressure at the mounting bolt holes, will definitely see bearing failure there and failure criterion says that it's going to basically double fail.

The hand calculated stresses worked well for regular beams, but as the aspect ratio increased, the results became further from the hand calculations. See 'Team-Formula SAE' > Vehicle Dynamics > Files > Excels > ‘DEFUNCT Wheel Hub Brake Flange Calculator.xlsx' for details and process. i.

Reduce corner Rolling e Roll itself isn't always harmful(Low center mass cars) e Most suspensions, roll= positive camber results in less grip e They reduce body roll, but not total lateral load transfer. e Softly sprung cars need anti roll on both ends. e High downforce cars often don’t need extra roll stiffening. 2. Adjust Handling balance e Anti roll bars can change roll stiffness front vs rear this changes understeer/oversteer balances. More front stiffness=more under steer and vice versa e FWD rear bar is key RWD front bar is key. Limitations/Tradeoffs ¢ Too much anti-roll stiffness makes suspension act less independent e Wheels on one axle move together like a rigid axle. e Increases chance of inside wheel lift in corners. e Anti-roll should not exceed 50% of total roll stiffness at either end. e Suspension must still be free to move through full bump/rebound",
